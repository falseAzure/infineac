      " Thank you. Good morning, everyone. With me this morning is Bob Campbell, President of the company, Mark Jackson, Chief Financial Officer, and Julie Robertson, Senior Vice President of Administration. We will go through our normal drill, that is, I'll ask Mark to make comments about the financial results, which I might add given the market, we're pleased of the results. And I'll turn the microphone over to Bob Campbell, and Bob can talk about the five issues, among other things, that were voted on yesterday at our shareholders meeting, and then I will close with some observations and -- about the next several quarters and perhaps some thoughts about '03, how '03 might be lining up. I'll spend some time talking about the technologies that we're working on. With that, I'll ask Mark Jackson to share with us points on the financials.\n",

      " Thank you, Jim. It's highlighted in our press release, first quarter earnings of 39 cents per share was slightly below last year's first quarter net income of 40 cents per share. Current results,$3.3 million for costs associated with the tax inversion and included in general and [INAUDIBLE] expense. The expense going forward approximate 6.5 million per quarter. Overall, our utilization dropped 1% to 86% in the first quarter this year. And reduced revenues by 1 million. This was offset by an increase in our dayrates to 62,700 per day, 2,000 more per day than last year, which added an addition at $2.8 million to our revenues. Operating costs in line with the fourth quarter, for Corporate effective tax rate, dropped to 17%, which reflects the mix and earnings being driven by international and the first quarter. Our tax rate should move closer to 20%. One last comment on the income statement. Included in other income expense, two gains. A 5.9 million dollar gain on the sale of our working interests in Falcon Prospect to Pioneer, and a 4 million dollar gain from the receipt of tax payments made in Canada related to the Bowden acquisition. We reclassify in the decline in our ocean rig stocks from temperature to permanent, which reduced the previously mentioned gains by 9.8 million you are. Our cash flow of $95 million funded 40 million of normal expenditures, with the remaining going to fund the previously disclosed acquisitions. We also utilized $59 million of our cash to fund the acquisitions. That's the total capitalization reduced to 24%, achieved by reducing debt 2% and increasing equity 4% during the quarter. With those comments, I'll turn it over to Bob.\n",

      " Thank you, Mark. At our 2002 annual meeting of stockholders yesterday, all the items of business that were on our agenda were approved by stockholders. We elected two Directors to the Class of Directors for a three-year term, expiring in 2005. Approved amendments to two of our stock option plans. And also increased our authorized shares of capital stock from 200 million shares to 400 million shares, which will be available for issuance for proper Corporate purposes, without further shareholder action. With respect to our proposal to restructure our operations, we had an overwhelming endorsement of that proposal by our stockholders. Holders of 96.4% of the shares voting on the restructuring, voted in favor of the adoption. This will enable us to restructure so that our place of incorporation will be moved from Delaware to the Cayman Islands. The merger is scheduled to become effective after the close of business on April 30, 2002. And we will continue trading our stock under -- on the New York Stock Exchange, no changes in our trade simple, and stockholders will not have to do anything with respect to their certificates either. Just a couple of other comments on the restructuring to move our parent company, Noble Corporate Group, offshore. Our international operations accounted for 54% of our total operations in 2001 and 67% in the first quarter of this year. Net income attributable to our international operations during such periods was a higher percentage, and I think as everyone knows over 60% of our fleet of offshore assets are deployed into international markets. With our operations in the Gulf of Mexico, obviously, we will continue to pay U.S. taxes. But our new structure will promote our flexibility to reduce our worldwide effective Corporate tax rate. In addition, this new Corporate structure is generally more favor to expand our business through acquisitions in joint ventures. In the absence of the U.S. tax code that is more on a level playing field, the current tax system perhaps unwittingly could promote foreign takeovers of U.S. companies. As a leading provider of diversified service to the oil and gas industry, we're engaged in a global business with global competitive forces, and our Board of Directors yesterday our stockholders concur that they want us to remain competitive in the global marketplace. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Jim.\n",

      " Thank you, Bob. Before I start talking about activity, our activities around the world, I would add to what Bob said. We had very few comments from shareholders. I think there were a total of approximately 18 calls that we received. Once we explained why we were trying to make sure we remain competitive and that [INAUDIBLE] they all were in favor of the resolution to move overseas. I did receive two letters, is all, and again, most of them -- the two were under the impression that we were not going to pay any U.S. taxes, that the Officers were not going to pay any U.S. taxes, that somehow we would escape any exposure to U.S. taxes. And we tried to and did explain to them that we're going to continue to pay U.S. taxes on U.S. earned income, and that all we're trying to do is assure we remain competitive with our two largest competitors, Global Santa Fe and Transocean. With that, let me talk about -- there was a -- we were quoted yesterday in Reuters, and I think the lead part of the article was Noble says we're in for a rough year. For those of you that have read it, you needed -- the headline was really taken out of context. What I was saying that -- that clearly, with the possibility of an invasion of Iraq and given the political situation in Venezuela, that this could indeed be a challenging and rough year for the whole industry. We feel very comfortable with first call consensus, as we speak. But this is not a lay-down year. And I also made a comment in our news release that pronouncements by other in the drilling service sector that things are really starting to go up, I think -- I don't want anybody to jump off and believe that the turn has occurred. Fully -- anyone that's been involved with this industry over any length of time fully realizes that they're also going to be surprises. While yes, the Gulf of Mexico has started to improve, there are other areas that could be -- hold surprises. So don't -- don't jump on the hyperbole and think things have turned the corner. Without questioning what is going on [INAUDIBLE] Gulf of Mexico. We are saying improvement in in dayrates for jackups. Last recall from the last conference call, I indicated that what I did like at that point, it appeared dayrates were stopped falling. Right now, the first indication that dayrates are starting to improve. Now, they aren't -- they aren't running straight up, but we are seeing a thousand dollars here, three or four thousand dollars there. So that's a positive. Mexico continues to be rather slow in making commitments on rigs. They currently have plans for four additional rigs. They can either be MAP rigs or Independent Leg Cantilever rigs. They also have a need for one 300-foot jackup, in addition to the four, and after that we understand at some time in May, first of June, they'll have a requirement for a 350-foot independently cantilever jackup. So that process is still going. As we have indicated previously, that's a positive sign for the U.S. Gulf. Whenever it occurs we'll tighten the market in the U.S. Gulf, so we're very encouraged about that market. Hope to have additional units down before they're in. There's a possibility later in the year for in fact a semi, so you may also see a semi move out of the Gulf of Mexico. Venezuela, I don't need to spend a lot of time there. That was the quickest -- in reversal that in history of that sort of thing. As all of you are aware, we like that area. We like the geology in the lake. But I've also moved all of our rigs out quite some time ago because of the rather unusual political situation down there. I don't see any real help in Venezuela as far as taking rigs out of the Gulf of Mexico at this point in time. Brazil, Brazil continues to hold steady. Our operations continue there. We will in the second quarter pull one of our drill ships, The Leo, to do some upgrades to its drilling systems, so it will be down for a period. We don't see any need right now for additional semis. There has some discussion about jackups in Brazil, and we'll see if that develops later in the year. West Africa continues to be reasonably strong. We believe that there's -- will be an opportunity for a semi submersible and a jackup to go to that operating area. Hopefully, before year-end. So that's a positive sign. More than likely, they would be coming out of the Gulf Coast marine area, although it's possible that one jackup may come out of the North Sea. The North Sea is the weak sister, if you will. Internationally. Our competitors don't seem to learn that moving rigs on speck into a fully utilized market causes dayrate softening. I hope you write a book about that. And they tried to show the importance of demand and supply and that excess supply is going to kill demand, and dayrates, and -- but they don't seem to understand that. And there's some -- there's three idle rigs over there, and look for third, fourth quarter dayrates for jackups that are being rolled over to come down. If nothing else points to the importance of consolidation, it's the speculative move of rigs around the world. Middle East continues to be reasonably good. We obviously are concerned about the environment in the Middle East. I think most of you read some recent pronouncements by the leadership of Saudi Arabia about using oil as a political tool, a punitive tool. That is not good news. Obviously, the continued discussion about invasion of Iraq is not good news. But right now, things are reasonably subtle. Operations are going well. We've had no interruptions. East Coast of Canada, Hibernia, continues to operate, nothing to talk about there in terms of expansion at this point. The rigs in China, the idle rigs that we have recently bought, the Bingo 9,000 units and the Day Beard, Freeman Goldman semi-submersible, we're not doing anything on them at this point, but once the repurchase option expires, we will begin doing engineering and prepare for upgrading the two latter acquisitions. Let me talk about technology briefly. We have a lot of interest in our Alreiser. We're approximately 70% through our first complete production for our alloy reiser. And it's either en route or will be en route to Brazil in short order. And so that's going well, the manufacturing process. We will continue to manufacture additional strings and utilize them on other rigs in our fleet to take them into deeper water, more cost effectively than others using steel reiser. Once we get through with supplying, we will allow this technology to be licensed by others, and if so, we hope principally as production reiser which will will be a great market for. We have or will be making some announcements over the next 30 days on small acquisitions of technology. They're not big-dollar acquisitions, but we believe -- we're very optimistic they will have a nice impact on results in 2003 and 2004. Terms of our proprietary design Drill-Smart tool, I think we have 10 or -- nine or 10 units out. We will be staffing up hopefully over the next three to four quarters to increase the number of units we have out, not only on our fleet but on others around the world. Let me talk briefly about the two units that we recently bought from one of our competitors. They are now in the ship yard. We're assessing the amount of work that needs to be done on the units. What we will be doing as we previously announced is spending anywhere from 25 to $35 million, increasing the quarters. The quarters were not in Noble shape for our personnel, and we will completely renovate the quarters and actually increase the number of personnel that can live on them, from 80 to 110 to 120. We'll also work on the BOP handling system that the units had an antiquated system, and we'll bring them in line with our more technologically advanced systems on our EBA's. And we'll also stretch the units in terms of water depth, hopefully get them up to 4,000 feet, and perhaps up to 6,000 feet. We have interestingly enough completed previous engineering on similar designs to take them to 10,000 feet, so we know it can be done. It's obviously more money, but right now we're just targeting 4,000 feet. With that, I am confident that at this point, bargain some major surprising, that first call estimates are achievable by Noble. We're going to keep focused as we have in times past, and try to continue to lead this sector with returns on capitol and shareholder appreciation. I will now open the call to any questions you might have.\n",

      " Jim, just I want to ask a quick question on the inversion. Talk to us a little bit about tax rate implications for this. If we were to look at 2001, around a 25% tax rate. If we were to repeat that going forward, kind of adjusting for the U.S. International mix, what would that tax rate be in a year like 2001?\n",

      " James Day,    [15]\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " We haven't put a number on it. But in my marketing guide, probably shudder because we don't want to -- these are negotiated, so I don't want to set up a target for them. But they will be -- I can see softening of 5, 5 or 6,000 dollars a day.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Scott Gill,    [16]\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Okay. And then lastly for me, on West Africa, you talked about demand for a semi and for a jackup. And could you talk a little bit about your philosophy there on moving a rig from other markets into West Africa.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " James Day,    [17]\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " You bet. It hasn't changed. Are you testing my memory or -- they will pay for Noble Drilling moving over there. And we're not moving on [INAUDIBLE]. Dayrate, if you look at the day rates there for 250s to 300-foot units, they're going to be I would guess somewhere in the 50s to the 60s, maybe mid-60s depending on what is required on the contracts. On the semi-submersible, again, they're going to pay the move and depending on the water depth again, so there's several variables here. But you're going to see 120, 110 to 120 to maybe as high as 150 on a semi-submersible. In that 4,000-foot range.\n",

      " James Day,    [19]\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Well, I mean, I'm optimistic. There's an opportunity for rigs over there, and we want our share, and we should get our share because we're there. I know there are other companies right now, Scott, that don't have any operations over there. That would like to move a rig. But as you would guess, that's extremely inefficient, and not very cost-effective to have a single rig operation in a remote area like that. But we want our share. It's like Mexico, we're still believing we will get our share down there, even though it's a little slower than we think. West Africa is no different.\n",

      " KEN FIELD,    [23]\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Good morning, gentlemen. Jim, I'd like to get your thoughts on where you see the deepwater going over the next -- the course of 2002 and maybe into 2003. You know, clearly, a lot of people are hearing about the lack of success in the Gulf of Mexico. Lack of success in Brazil. And yet you guys continue to put more capital, it looks like, into that deepwater market and into the jackup rigs.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " James Day,    [24]\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " If I could find -- Ken, as you heard me say before, it's been suggested we get completely out of the jackup business and the future as deepwater, 24 months ago. Now at once, everybody understood my strategy of having a balanced operation. If we could find opportunistic jackup purchases, we would do it. 300-foot jackups. We till like jackups. We just happen to believe near-term this our clients are more interested in very uniquely designed and engineered deepwater units. Now, I know others have said there is not a need for any more deepwater units. I would agree with that, in general. But I certainly wouldn't be -- if I had a large number of drillships, which are principally exploratory tools, I wouldn't feel good about the future of deepwater. There's way too much capacity brought in too quick, and that's the reason we didn't chase that market. I mean, there was a strategic reason for Noble not running at that, even though we had a great infrastructure. The future will be in the developmental type applications. With uniquely designed semis that have good motion characteristics, stay on location, and not cost an arm and a leg to operate, which the ships certainly are quite expensive. I know there's been some disappointments. In that intermediate depth of deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico, and there's been some disappointment in Brazil. But there's still a lot of interest in talking to the majors in deepwater and the Gulf of Mexico. And you know them. And -- so we're still encouraged about it. We're not talking about slugging the market with a half dozen rigs. What we're doing, as you're aware, with the Boudreaux is doing a preliminary steelwork for that unit to work in the Golden Triangle. We didn't talk about West Africa, but West Africa -- I mean, you can argue there's been some near-term disappointment there, but not substantial amount of disappointment, and there's still very excited about the geology in West Africa. So would I be [INAUDIBLE] I had a bunch of drillships just built, worrying about deepwater markets? You bet. Very unique semis that are designed and engineered specifically for application by certain operators, I think we -- we've been able to find those initials with our equipment and have very close relationship with operators, and I believe we'll be able to do that in the future as well.\n",

      " KEN FIELD,    [25]\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Well, so you're clearly targeting the develop meant market, which just seems to be slow to wrap up. Do you see that break open in 2002, and how much of that is caution on the majors because of the new technology versus uncertainty about oil prices?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " James Day,    [26]\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " I think it's -- that's a good point, Ken. It's actually both. There have been a lot of disappointments in the technological results equipment being down, when it shouldn't be, reliability of certain assets. I mean, there's some really horse stories on equipment failure. The other side of it, I guess in that same vein, some of the majors short of people. I know that one of [INAUDIBLE] trying to move projects alone, if you visited with the staff, they do not have the staff to keep these projects moving. So I think it's personnel constraints. And the other, as far as the geological disappointment, there has been some, but we have interesting opportunities. People like Kerr-McGee, smaller people like Murphy. Those folks have all been -- done reasonably well, and there's others want to go get in it. There's some independents trying to buy properties we're aware of right now, and in fact -- Mr. Jackson alluded to the sale of some of our interests. There's an independent that wants to get into that deeper water.\n",

Jim you commented some of your competitors are looking to enter that market that aren't there. I think of Noble, Global Santa Fe, Transocean as being big players in the market. Cue give us a sense of how you will approach the market if one of the other companies goes out and bids aggressively. We still have a goal post spread between 300-foot jackup dayrates in the Gulf, vis-a-vis what the rigs would garner in West Africa.

You pay for that experience, and the folks with the most experience would be Noble and Global, and day in day out, and we're not going to react to -- you picked a -- example of Childs. Since we bought Childs, we know quite aware financially what happened to them. They died doing what they did. And others that bid aggressively in that market that don't understand the operational requirements, supervisory requirements, financial requirements, aren't going to make any money.

One of the things that we as you're aware, when we bought Neddrill, was to purposely stay out of the U.K. side, because anybody can move in and out of there generally speaking. And what we did is focused on the more heavily regulated areas, Denmark, Holland, even up into Norway, and take on that -- be aggressive in our acceptance of those regulations, work with the local regulatory agencies, and we believe that it helps put news a unique marketing position. Others have tried to come in, and they failed to meet the regulatory requirements that are set in those countries.

      " First on the Gulf of Mexico, looking at the most recent monthly rig update, the current rates or next rates, I should say, versus last month, that delta for the fleet, average was about an 11% increase. Even with one of the rigs dropping from 40 into the mid-30s. That's a pretty healthy uptake for a market that's not as well utilized as Gulf of Mexico is. In fact, it just went back and looked at stats on this and it was November to December '99 that we saw the last time we saw a move similar to that. I guess what I want to try to do is reconcile comments that you made in the press release and comments made on this call with a data point, such as that. Pretty decent movement in the average rate structure for those rigs. Could we be an influx -- inflection point it's late '99ish that we'll see in the Gulf or as you pointed out in your comments, stall out here for a little while?\n",

And what I don't -- being the young man that you are, and you know all the scars that I've had, every time that I think I understand something, even the number of years I've been in this business, I get surprised. I don't believe -- here's the problem, as you know on the shelf in the u.S. Gulf. Unless you're going deep, and the deeper projects, deep gas on the shelf, the smaller reservoirs that all the independents experience are very price-sensitive to dayrates some we might have -- in other words, you might have these movements offered a low of 11, 12, 13%, that look like nice. It's that movement off of a -- the next high, the next leg up, that we'll start encountering some pressure. So the fact that the majority of the projects on the shelf, shallow water, shallow formations, gas driven, are so price sensitive, I think you're going to run into some head wind later in the year.

We have -- in my mind, some of the -- as far as market information and understanding the client, we've got a good marketing group. We've got a good, strong group there. And they have held up well. It could be a turnaround. We could see some softening. Let's assume one or two rigs move out of the North Sea, then you change the completion of that. It's that one rigor two rigs that sits around that the operators know how to play the game. And so yes, it could be a reasonably quick turnaround. And our marketing people have done a -- have really performed very well over the terms of dayrates. But I think it also is reflective of -- to Mark's point, we stayed in our little neck of the woods, and tried to elbow everybody else out, and we've also had -- we have a great operating reputation there. As you know, there's been some really disasters in the North Sea recently, in terms of horrendous accidents. And our operation has done very, very well in that respect.\n",

      " Sir, I have a couple quick questions for you. Number one, I guess I'll be blunt. Jim, what do you trying to accomplish on the technology side in terms of short and long-term thoughts there? And number two, is there a potential for you to make a more dramatic acquisition on that side of the business?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " James Day,    [94]\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " I'll answer them in reverse order. Yes, there could be dramatic -- let me define that. I'm not talking about -- I want to put a bracket around that -- dramatic could be four or 500 million dollar acquisition, something that of. Could question we're do that? Yes. Have we looked at it? Yes. The numbers haven't worked yet. But they might. So yes, we could step up. I'm not talking about dramatic in terms of two or 3 billion dollars. At least at this point. But there are some small intermediate type companies like that that make sense. Now, the acquisitions I alluded to accumulatively would be less than 20 million dollars we're currently talking about. So I'll give you an order of magnitude. And where are we going? I believe that dayrates, particularly deepwater, highly technical drilling, will go back up. And I know everyone on the phone hopes that they will go back up. But I think that as they start reaching back to -- reaching their old levels or surpassing them, that our clients -- and if you remember, I have representatives from Shell, BP, and independent called Kerm, GE, on my Board. And what I can say is people will demand more than just a trialer showing up on location with his drilling rig and saying, what do you want me to do? They're going to demand more, greater abilities in terms of technology. They're going to be more demanding on operating efficiencies. They're going to be more demanding of our people in terms of providing guidance and assistance. This whole period that we went through when everybody was saying, boy, look at the drillers, they're automatically going to this theoretical replacement dayrates, without providing anything for the clients. You've heard me say this before, it's silly. And in order for us to have these dayrates keep action system rating, we have to provide additional services. What we are doing with the technology, we're taking technology that can part of it be developed from within, with internal expertise, and we're going to marry that with unique technologies that are external and that really add to our efficiencies on our rigs. We're going to apply our Drill-Smart tool. We're going to be our rigs coming out the Boudreaux and others will have -- will be classified as a smart rig, which is -- has a whole variety of sensing systems, predictive systems, systems that make our drillers and rig managers more efficient. And we think that's got for part and parcel of what the future holds. Showing up, charging something a dayrate, and thinking that's going to suffice is silly. And the market shouldn't buy it either.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " Two more follow-ups. One, related to that, is the thought process at all try to create a more stable earnings basis? Frankly, you've done a pretty good job with long-term contracts, and creating pretty stable earnings base relative to your pierce. And the second is talking about smart rigs. Here's a dumb question. Do you in terms of your competition, who do you think your competition is going forward? Is it Global Santa Fe, Transocean, or is it now somebody else in terms of service companies?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " James Day,    [96]\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      " No, those are great questions. You always have great questions. As you know, the backup give a little history, when we were acquiring different companies and we were attempting to set up benchmarks on how good we were, relative to our peer group, all the drillers had a tendency so to say we're the best guy in the world, but the reality is there's no benchmark that anybody used. We typically were dealing with personalities more than anything else. And Triton was a wonderful -- has been and will be a wonderful tool for us to measure what we did relative to our peer group because they used all of our peer groups' assets. So the first thing we did is set benchmarks and then we're really competing against ourselves in many -- in many regions. We can show our benchmark is -- and the results we achieve is far superior to any of the companies you alluded to. The other thing that -- it's not just operational. It's engineering. As you know, we have created a tremendous amount of value, as you know because you've been down to see the assets, of doing engineering and commissioning of our rigs and such a manner that we far exceeded any returns that our competitors will ever achieve. Some of the massive overruns by some of the companies you alluded to, they will never achieve a return on capital. The units at some point in my mind will have to be written down. So -- not to sound too boastful because we're not that way, but we don't look at the other drillers in and of themselves, anyone that you talked about, as competitors. They have drilling assets that will -- that we look at that -- from a design standpoint are interesting. But across the board, we really don't look at them as our major competitors. It's usually individual drilling assets. In terms of the technology giving us a more stable earnings base, I do appreciate your comment about we have done a reasonably good job. I think we've done a great job, on having steady earnings. I know there's a lot of discussion about long-term contracts, but I think the market today has fully appreciated was we were trying to do, and will do, selectively in the future. The technology can provide a different earnings base. For example, with the aluminum -- with the alloy riser, if we use that in a production mode, our clients will be the Shell's, the BP's, the objects of this world, and that will be a market that will be very unique. It will meet not too far afield from what we do, but a new, unique market. And what's wonderful about that, that is the latter part of the developmental mode. We go out and drill the wells. Then they start developing it. If he use tools of ours to do that, that just extends our exposure to the well bore. And so yes, this technology can provide some additional stability.\n",

During the presentations, all participants will be in the listen-only mode. Afterwards we'll conduct a question and answer session. At that time, if you have a question, press the 1 followed by the 4 on your telephone. This conference call is being recorded Friday April 26, 2002. I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. James Day, Chairman and CEO of Noble Drilling Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [2]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you. Good morning, everyone. With me this morning is Bob Campbell, President of the company, Mark Jackson, Chief Financial Officer, and Julie Robertson, Senior Vice President of Administration. We will go through our normal drill, that is, I'll ask Mark to make comments about the financial results, which I might add given the market, we're pleased of the results. And I'll turn the microphone over to Bob Campbell, and Bob can talk about the five issues, among other things, that were voted on yesterday at our shareholders meeting, and then I will close with some observations and -- about the next several quarters and perhaps some thoughts about '03, how '03 might be lining up. I'll spend some time talking about the technologies that we're working on. With that, I'll ask Mark Jackson to share with us points on the financials.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Mark Jackson,    [3]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Jim. It's highlighted in our press release, first quarter earnings of 39 cents per share was slightly below last year's first quarter net income of 40 cents per share. Current results,$3.3 million for costs associated with the tax inversion and included in general and [INAUDIBLE] expense. The expense going forward approximate 6.5 million per quarter. Overall, our utilization dropped 1% to 86% in the first quarter this year. And reduced revenues by 1 million. This was offset by an increase in our dayrates to 62,700 per day, 2,000 more per day than last year, which added an addition at $2.8 million to our revenues. Operating costs in line with the fourth quarter, for Corporate effective tax rate, dropped to 17%, which reflects the mix and earnings being driven by international and the first quarter. Our tax rate should move closer to 20%. One last comment on the income statement. Included in other income expense, two gains. A 5.9 million dollar gain on the sale of our working interests in Falcon Prospect to Pioneer, and a 4 million dollar gain from the receipt of tax payments made in Canada related to the Bowden acquisition. We reclassify in the decline in our ocean rig stocks from temperature to permanent, which reduced the previously mentioned gains by 9.8 million you are. Our cash flow of $95 million funded 40 million of normal expenditures, with the remaining going to fund the previously disclosed acquisitions. We also utilized $59 million of our cash to fund the acquisitions. That's the total capitalization reduced to 24%, achieved by reducing debt 2% and increasing equity 4% during the quarter. With those comments, I'll turn it over to Bob.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bob Campbell,    [4]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Mark. At our 2002 annual meeting of stockholders yesterday, all the items of business that were on our agenda were approved by stockholders. We elected two Directors to the Class of Directors for a three-year term, expiring in 2005. Approved amendments to two of our stock option plans. And also increased our authorized shares of capital stock from 200 million shares to 400 million shares, which will be available for issuance for proper Corporate purposes, without further shareholder action. With respect to our proposal to restructure our operations, we had an overwhelming endorsement of that proposal by our stockholders. Holders of 96.4% of the shares voting on the restructuring, voted in favor of the adoption. This will enable us to restructure so that our place of incorporation will be moved from Delaware to the Cayman Islands. The merger is scheduled to become effective after the close of business on April 30, 2002. And we will continue trading our stock under -- on the New York Stock Exchange, no changes in our trade simple, and stockholders will not have to do anything with respect to their certificates either. Just a couple of other comments on the restructuring to move our parent company, Noble Corporate Group, offshore. Our international operations accounted for 54% of our total operations in 2001 and 67% in the first quarter of this year. Net income attributable to our international operations during such periods was a higher percentage, and I think as everyone knows over 60% of our fleet of offshore assets are deployed into international markets. With our operations in the Gulf of Mexico, obviously, we will continue to pay U.S. taxes. But our new structure will promote our flexibility to reduce our worldwide effective Corporate tax rate. In addition, this new Corporate structure is generally more favor to expand our business through acquisitions in joint ventures. In the absence of the U.S. tax code that is more on a level playing field, the current tax system perhaps unwittingly could promote foreign takeovers of U.S. companies. As a leading provider of diversified service to the oil and gas industry, we're engaged in a global business with global competitive forces, and our Board of Directors yesterday our stockholders concur that they want us to remain competitive in the global marketplace. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Jim.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [5]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Bob. Before I start talking about activity, our activities around the world, I would add to what Bob said. We had very few comments from shareholders. I think there were a total of approximately 18 calls that we received. Once we explained why we were trying to make sure we remain competitive and that [INAUDIBLE] they all were in favor of the resolution to move overseas. I did receive two letters, is all, and again, most of them -- the two were under the impression that we were not going to pay any U.S. taxes, that the Officers were not going to pay any U.S. taxes, that somehow we would escape any exposure to U.S. taxes. And we tried to and did explain to them that we're going to continue to pay U.S. taxes on U.S. earned income, and that all we're trying to do is assure we remain competitive with our two largest competitors, Global Santa Fe and Transocean. With that, let me talk about -- there was a -- we were quoted yesterday in Reuters, and I think the lead part of the article was Noble says we're in for a rough year. For those of you that have read it, you needed -- the headline was really taken out of context. What I was saying that -- that clearly, with the possibility of an invasion of Iraq and given the political situation in Venezuela, that this could indeed be a challenging and rough year for the whole industry. We feel very comfortable with first call consensus, as we speak. But this is not a lay-down year. And I also made a comment in our news release that pronouncements by other in the drilling service sector that things are really starting to go up, I think -- I don't want anybody to jump off and believe that the turn has occurred. Fully -- anyone that's been involved with this industry over any length of time fully realizes that they're also going to be surprises. While yes, the Gulf of Mexico has started to improve, there are other areas that could be -- hold surprises. So don't -- don't jump on the hyperbole and think things have turned the corner. Without questioning what is going on [INAUDIBLE] Gulf of Mexico. We are saying improvement in in dayrates for jackups. Last recall from the last conference call, I indicated that what I did like at that point, it appeared dayrates were stopped falling. Right now, the first indication that dayrates are starting to improve. Now, they aren't -- they aren't running straight up, but we are seeing a thousand dollars here, three or four thousand dollars there. So that's a positive. Mexico continues to be rather slow in making commitments on rigs. They currently have plans for four additional rigs. They can either be MAP rigs or Independent Leg Cantilever rigs. They also have a need for one 300-foot jackup, in addition to the four, and after that we understand at some time in May, first of June, they'll have a requirement for a 350-foot independently cantilever jackup. So that process is still going. As we have indicated previously, that's a positive sign for the U.S. Gulf. Whenever it occurs we'll tighten the market in the U.S. Gulf, so we're very encouraged about that market. Hope to have additional units down before they're in. There's a possibility later in the year for in fact a semi, so you may also see a semi move out of the Gulf of Mexico. Venezuela, I don't need to spend a lot of time there. That was the quickest -- in reversal that in history of that sort of thing. As all of you are aware, we like that area. We like the geology in the lake. But I've also moved all of our rigs out quite some time ago because of the rather unusual political situation down there. I don't see any real help in Venezuela as far as taking rigs out of the Gulf of Mexico at this point in time. Brazil, Brazil continues to hold steady. Our operations continue there. We will in the second quarter pull one of our drill ships, The Leo, to do some upgrades to its drilling systems, so it will be down for a period. We don't see any need right now for additional semis. There has some discussion about jackups in Brazil, and we'll see if that develops later in the year. West Africa continues to be reasonably strong. We believe that there's -- will be an opportunity for a semi submersible and a jackup to go to that operating area. Hopefully, before year-end. So that's a positive sign. More than likely, they would be coming out of the Gulf Coast marine area, although it's possible that one jackup may come out of the North Sea. The North Sea is the weak sister, if you will. Internationally. Our competitors don't seem to learn that moving rigs on speck into a fully utilized market causes dayrate softening. I hope you write a book about that. And they tried to show the importance of demand and supply and that excess supply is going to kill demand, and dayrates, and -- but they don't seem to understand that. And there's some -- there's three idle rigs over there, and look for third, fourth quarter dayrates for jackups that are being rolled over to come down. If nothing else points to the importance of consolidation, it's the speculative move of rigs around the world. Middle East continues to be reasonably good. We obviously are concerned about the environment in the Middle East. I think most of you read some recent pronouncements by the leadership of Saudi Arabia about using oil as a political tool, a punitive tool. That is not good news. Obviously, the continued discussion about invasion of Iraq is not good news. But right now, things are reasonably subtle. Operations are going well. We've had no interruptions. East Coast of Canada, Hibernia, continues to operate, nothing to talk about there in terms of expansion at this point. The rigs in China, the idle rigs that we have recently bought, the Bingo 9,000 units and the Day Beard, Freeman Goldman semi-submersible, we're not doing anything on them at this point, but once the repurchase option expires, we will begin doing engineering and prepare for upgrading the two latter acquisitions. Let me talk about technology briefly. We have a lot of interest in our Alreiser. We're approximately 70% through our first complete production for our alloy reiser. And it's either en route or will be en route to Brazil in short order. And so that's going well, the manufacturing process. We will continue to manufacture additional strings and utilize them on other rigs in our fleet to take them into deeper water, more cost effectively than others using steel reiser. Once we get through with supplying, we will allow this technology to be licensed by others, and if so, we hope principally as production reiser which will will be a great market for. We have or will be making some announcements over the next 30 days on small acquisitions of technology. They're not big-dollar acquisitions, but we believe -- we're very optimistic they will have a nice impact on results in 2003 and 2004. Terms of our proprietary design Drill-Smart tool, I think we have 10 or -- nine or 10 units out. We will be staffing up hopefully over the next three to four quarters to increase the number of units we have out, not only on our fleet but on others around the world. Let me talk briefly about the two units that we recently bought from one of our competitors. They are now in the ship yard. We're assessing the amount of work that needs to be done on the units. What we will be doing as we previously announced is spending anywhere from 25 to $35 million, increasing the quarters. The quarters were not in Noble shape for our personnel, and we will completely renovate the quarters and actually increase the number of personnel that can live on them, from 80 to 110 to 120. We'll also work on the BOP handling system that the units had an antiquated system, and we'll bring them in line with our more technologically advanced systems on our EBA's. And we'll also stretch the units in terms of water depth, hopefully get them up to 4,000 feet, and perhaps up to 6,000 feet. We have interestingly enough completed previous engineering on similar designs to take them to 10,000 feet, so we know it can be done. It's obviously more money, but right now we're just targeting 4,000 feet. With that, I am confident that at this point, bargain some major surprising, that first call estimates are achievable by Noble. We're going to keep focused as we have in times past, and try to continue to lead this sector with returns on capitol and shareholder appreciation. I will now open the call to any questions you might have.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [6]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you.

PAUSE] Scott Gill with Diamonds and Company, please proceed.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Scott Gill,    [7]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Good morning, Jim.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [8]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Morning, Scott.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Scott Gill,    [9]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jim, just I want to ask a quick question on the inversion. Talk to us a little bit about tax rate implications for this. If we were to look at 2001, around a 25% tax rate. If we were to repeat that going forward, kind of adjusting for the U.S. International mix, what would that tax rate be in a year like 2001?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [10]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n  \\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Mark Jackson,    [11]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n It would have been below 20%.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Scott Gill,    [12]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. So your guidance of 20%, that included the inversion?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Mark Jackson,    [13]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n No no, it does not.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Scott Gill,    [14]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. Thank you. Jim, talk a little bit about the North Sea. You mentioned some dayrate rollovers in the third and fourth quarter. What do you anticipate market rates to be in that period?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [15]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n We haven't put a number on it. But in my marketing guide, probably shudder because we don't want to -- these are negotiated, so I don't want to set up a target for them. But they will be -- I can see softening of 5, 5 or 6,000 dollars a day.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Scott Gill,    [16]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. And then lastly for me, on West Africa, you talked about demand for a semi and for a jackup. And could you talk a little bit about your philosophy there on moving a rig from other markets into West Africa.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [17]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n You bet. It hasn't changed. Are you testing my memory or -- they will pay for Noble Drilling moving over there. And we're not moving on [INAUDIBLE]. Dayrate, if you look at the day rates there for 250s to 300-foot units, they're going to be I would guess somewhere in the 50s to the 60s, maybe mid-60s depending on what is required on the contracts. On the semi-submersible, again, they're going to pay the move and depending on the water depth again, so there's several variables here. But you're going to see 120, 110 to 120 to maybe as high as 150 on a semi-submersible. In that 4,000-foot range.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Scott Gill,    [18]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Were you earlier talking about the market will move a rig, or Noble will move a rig to West Africa?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [19]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Well, I mean, I'm optimistic. There's an opportunity for rigs over there, and we want our share, and we should get our share because we're there. I know there are other companies right now, Scott, that don't have any operations over there. That would like to move a rig. But as you would guess, that's extremely inefficient, and not very cost-effective to have a single rig operation in a remote area like that. But we want our share. It's like Mexico, we're still believing we will get our share down there, even though it's a little slower than we think. West Africa is no different.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Scott Gill,    [20]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Jim.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [21]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Scott.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [22]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question from Ken Field with CSFB. Please go ahead.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n KEN FIELD,    [23]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Good morning, gentlemen. Jim, I'd like to get your thoughts on where you see the deepwater going over the next -- the course of 2002 and maybe into 2003. You know, clearly, a lot of people are hearing about the lack of success in the Gulf of Mexico. Lack of success in Brazil. And yet you guys continue to put more capital, it looks like, into that deepwater market and into the jackup rigs.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [24]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n If I could find -- Ken, as you heard me say before, it's been suggested we get completely out of the jackup business and the future as deepwater, 24 months ago. Now at once, everybody understood my strategy of having a balanced operation. If we could find opportunistic jackup purchases, we would do it. 300-foot jackups. We till like jackups. We just happen to believe near-term this our clients are more interested in very uniquely designed and engineered deepwater units. Now, I know others have said there is not a need for any more deepwater units. I would agree with that, in general. But I certainly wouldn't be -- if I had a large number of drillships, which are principally exploratory tools, I wouldn't feel good about the future of deepwater. There's way too much capacity brought in too quick, and that's the reason we didn't chase that market. I mean, there was a strategic reason for Noble not running at that, even though we had a great infrastructure. The future will be in the developmental type applications. With uniquely designed semis that have good motion characteristics, stay on location, and not cost an arm and a leg to operate, which the ships certainly are quite expensive. I know there's been some disappointments. In that intermediate depth of deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico, and there's been some disappointment in Brazil. But there's still a lot of interest in talking to the majors in deepwater and the Gulf of Mexico. And you know them. And -- so we're still encouraged about it. We're not talking about slugging the market with a half dozen rigs. What we're doing, as you're aware, with the Boudreaux is doing a preliminary steelwork for that unit to work in the Golden Triangle. We didn't talk about West Africa, but West Africa -- I mean, you can argue there's been some near-term disappointment there, but not substantial amount of disappointment, and there's still very excited about the geology in West Africa. So would I be [INAUDIBLE] I had a bunch of drillships just built, worrying about deepwater markets? You bet. Very unique semis that are designed and engineered specifically for application by certain operators, I think we -- we've been able to find those initials with our equipment and have very close relationship with operators, and I believe we'll be able to do that in the future as well.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n KEN FIELD,    [25]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Well, so you're clearly targeting the develop meant market, which just seems to be slow to wrap up. Do you see that break open in 2002, and how much of that is caution on the majors because of the new technology versus uncertainty about oil prices?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [26]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I think it's -- that's a good point, Ken. It's actually both. There have been a lot of disappointments in the technological results equipment being down, when it shouldn't be, reliability of certain assets. I mean, there's some really horse stories on equipment failure. The other side of it, I guess in that same vein, some of the majors short of people. I know that one of [INAUDIBLE] trying to move projects alone, if you visited with the staff, they do not have the staff to keep these projects moving. So I think it's personnel constraints. And the other, as far as the geological disappointment, there has been some, but we have interesting opportunities. People like Kerr-McGee, smaller people like Murphy. Those folks have all been -- done reasonably well, and there's others want to go get in it. There's some independents trying to buy properties we're aware of right now, and in fact -- Mr. Jackson alluded to the sale of some of our interests. There's an independent that wants to get into that deeper water.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n KEN FIELD,    [27]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. Just one last question. What is your tax rate guidance with the inversion for '02 now?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [28]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n 02 tax rate guidance, probably, what, 2%. About 15%.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n KEN FIELD,    [29]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [30]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n And again, Ken, to what Mark indicated to Scott, that's because of the heavy emphasis in our results overseas. I guess Bob was commenting on that too.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n KEN FIELD,    [31]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n All right. Thank you, Jim.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [32]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Ken.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [33]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Bill Sanchez with Hard Wheels. Please proceed.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bill Sanchez,    [34]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Morning, Jim.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [35]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Hi, bill.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bill Sanchez,    [36]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jim, in the Middle East, you've got four jackups up for renewal in the second half of the year, currently working in about the mid-50s or so. What is your anticipation now for renewals on those rigs?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [37]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n We haven't had good -- oh, Bill, a good sense on where that will go. I would just going to be a swag right now because we really don't -- there's a lot of dynamics going on over there. And [INAUDIBLE] did you right now, if you want me to swag, I would say they're going to stay flat, roll over at current levels.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bill Sanchez,    [38]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. And you talked about Mexico and clearly a lot has been discussed -- regarding or the '97 once enhanced meet the specifications what they'll be looking for, and if so, does the timing on the completion of the first rig here, meet their current schedule, their timetable?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [39]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. Yes to all of that. The '96 is -- you have to get used to this, Bill. It's the lower Boos-Guard, and it would exceed their spex. In terms of people and systems on it, once we [INAUDIBLE] and what's nice about it, as you're aware, we can -- I'm not suggesting this will be our bid, but we can work that at about 70 to $75,000 range, and have about a 20% return on capital.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bill Sanchez,    [40]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Right. One last question, Jim. Is 70 million still the approved amount of capital that can be spent on the Boudreaux?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [41]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n It's actually been increased, it's around 90.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bill Sanchez,    [42]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Around 90. Okay.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [43]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n But don't be surprise ode if that's increased. We're not prepared to announce anything at this point but it's all tied to discussions with clients and comfort of the Board, at what level the Board gets comfortable with the real possibility of concluding something for that unit near-term.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bill Sanchez,    [44]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. So the discussions continue to be active with operators, despite the weakness, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater market right now?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [45]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n That is correct.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bill Sanchez,    [46]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Great.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [47]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n And it's not just in the U.S..\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bill Sanchez,    [48]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Jim.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [49]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n All right, Bill.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bill Sanchez,    [50]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you very much.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [51]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Take care.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [52]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Wesley Maat of RCM. Please proceed.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Wesley N. Maat,  Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein   [53]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Actually, it's Dresdner Climate. Good morning, gentlemen.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [54]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Good morning Wes, I wasn't sure what she had done to you.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Wesley N. Maat,  Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein   [55]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n We do RCM. It's a fine place to put a plug for a subsidiary of Dresdner Bank Worldwide. West African jackup market. Jim you commented some of your competitors are looking to enter that market that aren't there. I think of Noble, Global Santa Fe, Transocean as being big players in the market. Cue give us a sense of how you will approach the market if one of the other companies goes out and bids aggressively. We still have a goal post spread between 300-foot jackup dayrates in the Gulf, vis-a-vis what the rigs would garner in West Africa. Your strategy, if one of your competitors gets aggressive like the old Childs Offshore did 10 years ago, to tender that market.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [56]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n We -- Wes, we've had many chats about bidding and we're not going to chase the market down. Obviously, we have been there since 1989. And that is not an easy market. There are challenges there operational. And you have to you earn that experience. You pay for that experience, and the folks with the most experience would be Noble and Global, and day in day out, and we're not going to react to -- you picked a -- example of Childs. Since we bought Childs, we know quite aware financially what happened to them. They died doing what they did. And others that bid aggressively in that market that don't understand the operational requirements, supervisory requirements, financial requirements, aren't going to make any money. So there's really no need to chase that market. I also have tried to remind some competitors that it wasn't just around 20, 22 months ago, that fully 60% of the rigs on West Coast of Africa were down.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Wesley N. Maat,  Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein   [57]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Some housekeeping items. STA looked a little high, compared to what I was looking at the 9.2 million in the second quarter. What is a realistic outlook for the next couple quarters?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [58]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Go ahead, Mark. Mark wants to respond to that.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Mark Jackson,    [59]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I would use something in range of 6.5 million dollars. And included in that -- in our it, and a this season was 3.4 million dollars associated with our tax inversion project. We just expensed that.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Wesley N. Maat,  Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein   [60]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. Great. Interest expense, guidance, should we expect it to rise, stay flat, going down over the next couple quarters?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [61]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Wes, it will be flat.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Wesley N. Maat,  Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein   [62]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. And just one final comment. INAUDIBLE] Love that name. Julia Robertson and names like that are wonderful names for rigs, but that's a great name.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [63]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n He's great individual. You would enjoy him. He had 43 years service with the company.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Wesley N. Maat,  Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein   [64]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n There you go. Thank you very much.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [65]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [66]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Mark Urnis with Salomon Smith Barney. Please proceed.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n MARK URNIS,    [67]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Good morning, Jim.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [68]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Hey, Mark.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n MARK URNIS,    [69]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Just wanted to ask, you included a quote on the North Sea with bad news last week with the new tax that the U.K. Government decided on. Most rigs fortunately, aren't in the U.K.. But could you comment on the ability of jackups to move from the UK into your markets, if in fact next year the U.K. market is weaker?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [70]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n That's a fair question. One of the things that we as you're aware, when we bought Neddrill, was to purposely stay out of the U.K. side, because anybody can move in and out of there generally speaking. And what we did is focused on the more heavily regulated areas, Denmark, Holland, even up into Norway, and take on that -- be aggressive in our acceptance of those regulations, work with the local regulatory agencies, and we believe that it helps put news a unique marketing position. Others have tried to come in, and they failed to meet the regulatory requirements that are set in those countries. But notwithstanding that fact, if others worked hard enough at it, they could eventually get in. But it's not going to be an overnight -- overnight ability to get in there. It's going to take awhile.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n MARK URNIS,    [71]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. And then wanted to ask a follow-up to Ken's earlier questions on the Gulf of Mexico. Deepwater marketing. Most of your units are committed, but you've got a couple that have available time. Do you think that the deeper water -- I say 4,000 and beyond, the rates will hold up, given there's equipment there as well?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [72]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I think you'll see some softening, but it will hold up reasonably well. We've got the Ferrington -- it will be close to six figures, coming off, going on to another. And we did that -- we could -- probably gotten slightly higher date dayrate. But what we're attempting to do is tie it to international work. So there's a little reasoning -- a reason for our bidding on that. But I think most of that stuff, 4,000 plus, should hang in there, six figures and above, roughly.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n MARK URNIS,    [73]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Jim.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [74]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you very much, Mark.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [75]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Michael Lamont with J.P. Morgan.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Michael Lamont,    [76]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Good morning, gentlemen.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [77]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Hello, Michael.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Michael Lamont,    [78]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n First on the Gulf of Mexico, looking at the most recent monthly rig update, the current rates or next rates, I should say, versus last month, that delta for the fleet, average was about an 11% increase. Even with one of the rigs dropping from 40 into the mid-30s. That's a pretty healthy uptake for a market that's not as well utilized as Gulf of Mexico is. In fact, it just went back and looked at stats on this and it was November to December '99 that we saw the last time we saw a move similar to that. I guess what I want to try to do is reconcile comments that you made in the press release and comments made on this call with a data point, such as that. Pretty decent movement in the average rate structure for those rigs. Could we be an influx -- inflection point it's late '99ish that we'll see in the Gulf or as you pointed out in your comments, stall out here for a little while?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [79]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Well, Michael, that is interesting. We hadn't looked back at the '99, November-December move. We'll pull that up later and review that. That we have had a nice move. And what I don't -- being the young man that you are, and you know all the scars that I've had, every time that I think I understand something, even the number of years I've been in this business, I get surprised. I don't believe -- here's the problem, as you know on the shelf in the u.S. Gulf. Unless you're going deep, and the deeper projects, deep gas on the shelf, the smaller reservoirs that all the independents experience are very price-sensitive to dayrates some we might have -- in other words, you might have these movements offered a low of 11, 12, 13%, that look like nice. It's that movement off of a -- the next high, the next leg up, that we'll start encountering some pressure. So the fact that the majority of the projects on the shelf, shallow water, shallow formations, gas driven, are so price sensitive, I think you're going to run into some head wind later in the year. That's all I'm talking about.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Michael Lamont,    [80]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [81]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n That make sense?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Michael Lamont,    [82]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n It does. It does. I like them when we throw out just raw numbers of 11 or 15 or 20%, and we've got -- if I were inclined to high person [INAUDIBLE], we have one that just jumped about 18%. One of our long legged jackups. Another 20%, excuse me. Penciling in some [INAUDIBLE]. If I were inclined to hyperbole and pumped the market, we're getting 20%. But it's 20% off [INAUDIBLE] Regular numbers.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [83]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n That's right, Mike. That's right.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Michael Lamont,    [84]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. The other question I have was with respect to the North Sea and your comments of the third and possibly fourth quarter softening and five to 6,000 dollars a day. You're pretty well covered in terms of extensions there, for example, the how wide is looking at a nice jump into that time frame. Congratulations to your marketing guys, I guess, first of all.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [85]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yeah.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Michael Lamont,    [86]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Second of all, how -- if that does -- if that weakness does materialize in the second half, is it something that we could get over quickly into '03, such that your exposure would be relatively minimal? That weakness.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [87]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n To your point on our marketing people, they tell me how good they are too. And they are. We have -- in my mind, some of the -- as far as market information and understanding the client, we've got a good marketing group. We've got a good, strong group there. And they have held up well. It could be a turnaround. We could see some softening. Let's assume one or two rigs move out of the North Sea, then you change the completion of that. It's that one rigor two rigs that sits around that the operators know how to play the game. And so yes, it could be a reasonably quick turnaround. And our marketing people have done a -- have really performed very well over the terms of dayrates. But I think it also is reflective of -- to Mark's point, we stayed in our little neck of the woods, and tried to elbow everybody else out, and we've also had -- we have a great operating reputation there. As you know, there's been some really disasters in the North Sea recently, in terms of horrendous accidents. And our operation has done very, very well in that respect.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Michael Lamont,    [88]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Jim.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [89]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Michael.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [90]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Eve Sickle with Wachovia Securities. Please go ahead.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n EVE SICKLE,    [91]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you. Good morning.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [92]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Morning.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n EVE SICKLE,    [93]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Sir, I have a couple quick questions for you. Number one, I guess I'll be blunt. Jim, what do you trying to accomplish on the technology side in terms of short and long-term thoughts there? And number two, is there a potential for you to make a more dramatic acquisition on that side of the business?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [94]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I'll answer them in reverse order. Yes, there could be dramatic -- let me define that. I'm not talking about -- I want to put a bracket around that -- dramatic could be four or 500 million dollar acquisition, something that of. Could question we're do that? Yes. Have we looked at it? Yes. The numbers haven't worked yet. But they might. So yes, we could step up. I'm not talking about dramatic in terms of two or 3 billion dollars. At least at this point. But there are some small intermediate type companies like that that make sense. Now, the acquisitions I alluded to accumulatively would be less than 20 million dollars we're currently talking about. So I'll give you an order of magnitude. And where are we going? I believe that dayrates, particularly deepwater, highly technical drilling, will go back up. And I know everyone on the phone hopes that they will go back up. But I think that as they start reaching back to -- reaching their old levels or surpassing them, that our clients -- and if you remember, I have representatives from Shell, BP, and independent called Kerm, GE, on my Board. And what I can say is people will demand more than just a trialer showing up on location with his drilling rig and saying, what do you want me to do? They're going to demand more, greater abilities in terms of technology. They're going to be more demanding on operating efficiencies. They're going to be more demanding of our people in terms of providing guidance and assistance. This whole period that we went through when everybody was saying, boy, look at the drillers, they're automatically going to this theoretical replacement dayrates, without providing anything for the clients. You've heard me say this before, it's silly. And in order for us to have these dayrates keep action system rating, we have to provide additional services. What we are doing with the technology, we're taking technology that can part of it be developed from within, with internal expertise, and we're going to marry that with unique technologies that are external and that really add to our efficiencies on our rigs. We're going to apply our Drill-Smart tool. We're going to be our rigs coming out the Boudreaux and others will have -- will be classified as a smart rig, which is -- has a whole variety of sensing systems, predictive systems, systems that make our drillers and rig managers more efficient. And we think that's got for part and parcel of what the future holds. Showing up, charging something a dayrate, and thinking that's going to suffice is silly. And the market shouldn't buy it either.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n EVE SICKLE,    [95]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Two more follow-ups. One, related to that, is the thought process at all try to create a more stable earnings basis? Frankly, you've done a pretty good job with long-term contracts, and creating pretty stable earnings base relative to your pierce. And the second is talking about smart rigs. Here's a dumb question. Do you in terms of your competition, who do you think your competition is going forward? Is it Global Santa Fe, Transocean, or is it now somebody else in terms of service companies?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [96]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n No, those are great questions. You always have great questions. As you know, the backup give a little history, when we were acquiring different companies and we were attempting to set up benchmarks on how good we were, relative to our peer group, all the drillers had a tendency so to say we're the best guy in the world, but the reality is there's no benchmark that anybody used. We typically were dealing with personalities more than anything else. And Triton was a wonderful -- has been and will be a wonderful tool for us to measure what we did relative to our peer group because they used all of our peer groups' assets. So the first thing we did is set benchmarks and then we're really competing against ourselves in many -- in many regions. We can show our benchmark is -- and the results we achieve is far superior to any of the companies you alluded to. The other thing that -- it's not just operational. It's engineering. As you know, we have created a tremendous amount of value, as you know because you've been down to see the assets, of doing engineering and commissioning of our rigs and such a manner that we far exceeded any returns that our competitors will ever achieve. Some of the massive overruns by some of the companies you alluded to, they will never achieve a return on capital. The units at some point in my mind will have to be written down. So -- not to sound too boastful because we're not that way, but we don't look at the other drillers in and of themselves, anyone that you talked about, as competitors. They have drilling assets that will -- that we look at that -- from a design standpoint are interesting. But across the board, we really don't look at them as our major competitors. It's usually individual drilling assets. In terms of the technology giving us a more stable earnings base, I do appreciate your comment about we have done a reasonably good job. I think we've done a great job, on having steady earnings. I know there's a lot of discussion about long-term contracts, but I think the market today has fully appreciated was we were trying to do, and will do, selectively in the future. The technology can provide a different earnings base. For example, with the aluminum -- with the alloy riser, if we use that in a production mode, our clients will be the Shell's, the BP's, the objects of this world, and that will be a market that will be very unique. It will meet not too far afield from what we do, but a new, unique market. And what's wonderful about that, that is the latter part of the developmental mode. We go out and drill the wells. Then they start developing it. If he use tools of ours to do that, that just extends our exposure to the well bore. And so yes, this technology can provide some additional stability.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n EVE SICKLE,    [97]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Jim. I appreciate the comments.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Day,    [98]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you. With that, we will conclude our conference call. If there are any other questions later on, please don't hesitate to call me, Bob Campbell, John Rynd, Judy, or Mark Jackson. On behalf of the Noble team, we appreciate your interest in our company. Best regards.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [99]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today.\\r\",\n",

Current results,$3.3 million for costs associated with the tax inversion and included in general and [INAUDIBLE] expense. The expense going forward approximate 6.5 million per quarter. Overall, our utilization dropped 1% to 86% in the first quarter this year. And reduced revenues by 1 million. This was offset by an increase in our dayrates to 62,700 per day, 2,000 more per day than last year, which added an addition at $2.8 million to our revenues. Operating costs in line with the fourth quarter, for Corporate effective tax rate, dropped to 17%, which reflects the mix and earnings being driven by international and the first quarter. Our tax rate should move closer to 20%. One last comment on the income statement. Included in other income expense, two gains. A 5.9 million dollar gain on the sale of our working interests in Falcon Prospect to Pioneer, and a 4 million dollar gain from the receipt of tax payments made in Canada related to the Bowden acquisition. We reclassify in the decline in our ocean rig stocks from temperature to permanent, which reduced the previously mentioned gains by 9.8 million you are. Our cash flow of $95 million funded 40 million of normal expenditures, with the remaining going to fund the previously disclosed acquisitions.

       "  \"Thank you, Mark. At our 2002 annual meeting of stockholders yesterday, all the items of business that were on our agenda were approved by stockholders. We elected two Directors to the Class of Directors for a three-year term, expiring in 2005. Approved amendments to two of our stock option plans. And also increased our authorized shares of capital stock from 200 million shares to 400 million shares, which will be available for issuance for proper Corporate purposes, without further shareholder action. With respect to our proposal to restructure our operations, we had an overwhelming endorsement of that proposal by our stockholders. Holders of 96.4% of the shares voting on the restructuring, voted in favor of the adoption. This will enable us to restructure so that our place of incorporation will be moved from Delaware to the Cayman Islands. The merger is scheduled to become effective after the close of business on April 30, 2002. And we will continue trading our stock under -- on the New York Stock Exchange, no changes in our trade simple, and stockholders will not have to do anything with respect to their certificates either. Just a couple of other comments on the restructuring to move our parent company, Noble Corporate Group, offshore. Our international operations accounted for 54% of our total operations in 2001 and 67% in the first quarter of this year. Net income attributable to our international operations during such periods was a higher percentage, and I think as everyone knows over 60% of our fleet of offshore assets are deployed into international markets. With our operations in the Gulf of Mexico, obviously, we will continue to pay U.S. taxes. But our new structure will promote our flexibility to reduce our worldwide effective Corporate tax rate. In addition, this new Corporate structure is generally more favor to expand our business through acquisitions in joint ventures. In the absence of the U.S. tax code that is more on a level playing field, the current tax system perhaps unwittingly could promote foreign takeovers of U.S. companies. As a leading provider of diversified service to the oil and gas industry, we're engaged in a global business with global competitive forces, and our Board of Directors yesterday our stockholders concur that they want us to remain competitive in the global marketplace. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Jim.\"],\n",

       "  \"Thank you, Bob. Before I start talking about activity, our activities around the world, I would add to what Bob said. We had very few comments from shareholders. I think there were a total of approximately 18 calls that we received. Once we explained why we were trying to make sure we remain competitive and that [INAUDIBLE] they all were in favor of the resolution to move overseas. I did receive two letters, is all, and again, most of them -- the two were under the impression that we were not going to pay any U.S. taxes, that the Officers were not going to pay any U.S. taxes, that somehow we would escape any exposure to U.S. taxes. And we tried to and did explain to them that we're going to continue to pay U.S. taxes on U.S. earned income, and that all we're trying to do is assure we remain competitive with our two largest competitors, Global Santa Fe and Transocean. With that, let me talk about -- there was a -- we were quoted yesterday in Reuters, and I think the lead part of the article was Noble says we're in for a rough year. For those of you that have read it, you needed -- the headline was really taken out of context. What I was saying that -- that clearly, with the possibility of an invasion of Iraq and given the political situation in Venezuela, that this could indeed be a challenging and rough year for the whole industry. We feel very comfortable with first call consensus, as we speak. But this is not a lay-down year. And I also made a comment in our news release that pronouncements by other in the drilling service sector that things are really starting to go up, I think -- I don't want anybody to jump off and believe that the turn has occurred. Fully -- anyone that's been involved with this industry over any length of time fully realizes that they're also going to be surprises. While yes, the Gulf of Mexico has started to improve, there are other areas that could be -- hold surprises. So don't -- don't jump on the hyperbole and think things have turned the corner. Without questioning what is going on [INAUDIBLE] Gulf of Mexico. We are saying improvement in in dayrates for jackups. Last recall from the last conference call, I indicated that what I did like at that point, it appeared dayrates were stopped falling. Right now, the first indication that dayrates are starting to improve. Now, they aren't -- they aren't running straight up, but we are seeing a thousand dollars here, three or four thousand dollars there. So that's a positive. Mexico continues to be rather slow in making commitments on rigs. They currently have plans for four additional rigs. They can either be MAP rigs or Independent Leg Cantilever rigs. They also have a need for one 300-foot jackup, in addition to the four, and after that we understand at some time in May, first of June, they'll have a requirement for a 350-foot independently cantilever jackup. So that process is still going. As we have indicated previously, that's a positive sign for the U.S. Gulf. Whenever it occurs we'll tighten the market in the U.S. Gulf, so we're very encouraged about that market. Hope to have additional units down before they're in. There's a possibility later in the year for in fact a semi, so you may also see a semi move out of the Gulf of Mexico. Venezuela, I don't need to spend a lot of time there. That was the quickest -- in reversal that in history of that sort of thing. As all of you are aware, we like that area. We like the geology in the lake. But I've also moved all of our rigs out quite some time ago because of the rather unusual political situation down there. I don't see any real help in Venezuela as far as taking rigs out of the Gulf of Mexico at this point in time. Brazil, Brazil continues to hold steady. Our operations continue there. We will in the second quarter pull one of our drill ships, The Leo, to do some upgrades to its drilling systems, so it will be down for a period. We don't see any need right now for additional semis. There has some discussion about jackups in Brazil, and we'll see if that develops later in the year. West Africa continues to be reasonably strong. We believe that there's -- will be an opportunity for a semi submersible and a jackup to go to that operating area. Hopefully, before year-end. So that's a positive sign. More than likely, they would be coming out of the Gulf Coast marine area, although it's possible that one jackup may come out of the North Sea. The North Sea is the weak sister, if you will. Internationally. Our competitors don't seem to learn that moving rigs on speck into a fully utilized market causes dayrate softening. I hope you write a book about that. And they tried to show the importance of demand and supply and that excess supply is going to kill demand, and dayrates, and -- but they don't seem to understand that. And there's some -- there's three idle rigs over there, and look for third, fourth quarter dayrates for jackups that are being rolled over to come down. If nothing else points to the importance of consolidation, it's the speculative move of rigs around the world. Middle East continues to be reasonably good. We obviously are concerned about the environment in the Middle East. I think most of you read some recent pronouncements by the leadership of Saudi Arabia about using oil as a political tool, a punitive tool. That is not good news. Obviously, the continued discussion about invasion of Iraq is not good news. But right now, things are reasonably subtle. Operations are going well. We've had no interruptions. East Coast of Canada, Hibernia, continues to operate, nothing to talk about there in terms of expansion at this point. The rigs in China, the idle rigs that we have recently bought, the Bingo 9,000 units and the Day Beard, Freeman Goldman semi-submersible, we're not doing anything on them at this point, but once the repurchase option expires, we will begin doing engineering and prepare for upgrading the two latter acquisitions. Let me talk about technology briefly. We have a lot of interest in our Alreiser. We're approximately 70% through our first complete production for our alloy reiser. And it's either en route or will be en route to Brazil in short order. And so that's going well, the manufacturing process. We will continue to manufacture additional strings and utilize them on other rigs in our fleet to take them into deeper water, more cost effectively than others using steel reiser. Once we get through with supplying, we will allow this technology to be licensed by others, and if so, we hope principally as production reiser which will will be a great market for. We have or will be making some announcements over the next 30 days on small acquisitions of technology. They're not big-dollar acquisitions, but we believe -- we're very optimistic they will have a nice impact on results in 2003 and 2004. Terms of our proprietary design Drill-Smart tool, I think we have 10 or -- nine or 10 units out. We will be staffing up hopefully over the next three to four quarters to increase the number of units we have out, not only on our fleet but on others around the world. Let me talk briefly about the two units that we recently bought from one of our competitors. They are now in the ship yard. We're assessing the amount of work that needs to be done on the units. What we will be doing as we previously announced is spending anywhere from 25 to $35 million, increasing the quarters. The quarters were not in Noble shape for our personnel, and we will completely renovate the quarters and actually increase the number of personnel that can live on them, from 80 to 110 to 120. We'll also work on the BOP handling system that the units had an antiquated system, and we'll bring them in line with our more technologically advanced systems on our EBA's. And we'll also stretch the units in terms of water depth, hopefully get them up to 4,000 feet, and perhaps up to 6,000 feet. We have interestingly enough completed previous engineering on similar designs to take them to 10,000 feet, so we know it can be done. It's obviously more money, but right now we're just targeting 4,000 feet. With that, I am confident that at this point, bargain some major surprising, that first call estimates are achievable by Noble. We're going to keep focused as we have in times past, and try to continue to lead this sector with returns on capitol and shareholder appreciation. I will now open the call to any questions you might have.\"],\n",

Now at once, everybody understood my strategy of having a balanced operation. If we could find opportunistic jackup purchases, we would do it. 300-foot jackups. We till like jackups. We just happen to believe near-term this our clients are more interested in very uniquely designed and engineered deepwater units. Now, I know others have said there is not a need for any more deepwater units. I would agree with that, in general. But I certainly wouldn't be -- if I had a large number of drillships, which are principally exploratory tools, I wouldn't feel good about the future of deepwater. There's way too much capacity brought in too quick, and that's the reason we didn't chase that market. I mean, there was a strategic reason for Noble not running at that, even though we had a great infrastructure. The future will be in the developmental type applications. With uniquely designed semis that have good motion characteristics, stay on location, and not cost an arm and a leg to operate, which the ships certainly are quite expensive. I know there's been some disappointments. In that intermediate depth of deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico, and there's been some disappointment in Brazil. But there's still a lot of interest in talking to the majors in deepwater and the Gulf of Mexico. And you know them. And -- so we're still encouraged about it. We're not talking about slugging the market with a half dozen rigs.

So would I be [INAUDIBLE] I had a bunch of drillships just built, worrying about deepwater markets? You bet.

I'm not talking about -- I want to put a bracket around that -- dramatic could be four or 500 million dollar acquisition, something that of. Could question we're do that? Yes. Have we looked at it? Yes. The numbers haven't worked yet. But they might. So yes, we could step up. I'm not talking about dramatic in terms of two or 3 billion dollars. At least at this point. But there are some small intermediate type companies like that that make sense. Now, the acquisitions I alluded to accumulatively would be less than 20 million dollars we're currently talking about. So I'll give you an order of magnitude. And where are we going? I believe that dayrates, particularly deepwater, highly technical drilling, will go back up. And I know everyone on the phone hopes that they will go back up. But I think that as they start reaching back to -- reaching their old levels or surpassing them, that our clients -- and if you remember, I have representatives from Shell, BP, and independent called Kerm, GE, on my Board. And what I can say is people will demand more than just a trialer showing up on location with his drilling rig and saying, what do you want me to do? They're going to demand more, greater abilities in terms of technology. They're going to be more demanding on operating efficiencies. They're going to be more demanding of our people in terms of providing guidance and assistance. This whole period that we went through when everybody was saying, boy, look at the drillers, they're automatically going to this theoretical replacement dayrates, without providing anything for the clients. You've heard me say this before, it's silly. And in order for us to have these dayrates keep action system rating, we have to provide additional services. What we are doing with the technology, we're taking technology that can part of it be developed from within, with internal expertise, and we're going to marry that with unique technologies that are external and that really add to our efficiencies on our rigs. We're going to apply our Drill-Smart tool. We're going to be our rigs coming out the Boudreaux and others will have -- will be classified as a smart rig, which is -- has a whole variety of sensing systems, predictive systems, systems that make our drillers and rig managers more efficient. And we think that's got for part and parcel of what the future holds. Showing up, charging something a dayrate, and thinking that's going to suffice is silly.

As you know, the backup give a little history, when we were acquiring different companies and we were attempting to set up benchmarks on how good we were, relative to our peer group, all the drillers had a tendency so to say we're the best guy in the world, but the reality is there's no benchmark that anybody used. We typically were dealing with personalities more than anything else. And Triton was a wonderful -- has been and will be a wonderful tool for us to measure what we did relative to our peer group because they used all of our peer groups' assets. So the first thing we did is set benchmarks and then we're really competing against ourselves in many -- in many regions. We can show our benchmark is -- and the results we achieve is far superior to any of the companies you alluded to. The other thing that -- it's not just operational. It's engineering. As you know, we have created a tremendous amount of value, as you know because you've been down to see the assets, of doing engineering and commissioning of our rigs and such a manner that we far exceeded any returns that our competitors will ever achieve. Some of the massive overruns by some of the companies you alluded to, they will never achieve a return on capital. The units at some point in my mind will have to be written down. So -- not to sound too boastful because we're not that way, but we don't look at the other drillers in and of themselves, anyone that you talked about, as competitors. They have drilling assets that will -- that we look at that -- from a design standpoint are interesting. But across the board, we really don't look at them as our major competitors. It's usually individual drilling assets. In terms of the technology giving us a more stable earnings base, I do appreciate your comment about we have done a reasonably good job. I think we've done a great job, on having steady earnings. I know there's a lot of discussion about long-term contracts, but I think the market today has fully appreciated was we were trying to do, and will do, selectively in the future. The technology can provide a different earnings base. For example, with the aluminum -- with the alloy riser, if we use that in a production mode, our clients will be the Shell's, the BP's, the objects of this world, and that will be a market that will be very unique. It will meet not too far afield from what we do, but a new, unique market. And what's wonderful about that, that is the latter part of the developmental mode. We go out and drill the wells. Then they start developing it. If he use tools of ours to do that, that just extends our exposure to the well bore. And so yes, this technology can provide some additional stability.\"],\n",

Overall, our utilization dropped 1% to 86% in the first quarter this year. And reduced revenues by 1 million. This was offset by an increase in our dayrates to 62,700 per day, 2,000 more per day than last year, which added an addition at $2.8 million to our revenues. Operating costs in line with the fourth quarter, for Corporate effective tax rate, dropped to 17%, which reflects the mix and earnings being driven by international and the first quarter. Our tax rate should move closer to 20%. One last comment on the income statement. Included in other income expense, two gains. A 5.9 million dollar gain on the sale of our working interests in Falcon Prospect to Pioneer, and a 4 million dollar gain from the receipt of tax payments made in Canada related to the Bowden acquisition. We reclassify in the decline in our ocean rig stocks from temperature to permanent, which reduced the previously mentioned gains by 9.8 million you are.

And also increased our authorized shares of capital stock from 200 million shares to 400 million shares, which will be available for issuance for proper Corporate purposes, without further shareholder action. With respect to our proposal to restructure our operations, we had an overwhelming endorsement of that proposal by our stockholders. Holders of 96.4% of the shares voting on the restructuring, voted in favor of the adoption. This will enable us to restructure so that our place of incorporation will be moved from Delaware to the Cayman Islands.

Our international operations accounted for 54% of our total operations in 2001 and 67% in the first quarter of this year. Net income attributable to our international operations during such periods was a higher percentage, and I think as everyone knows over 60% of our fleet of offshore assets are deployed into international markets. With our operations in the Gulf of Mexico, obviously, we will continue to pay U.S. taxes. But our new structure will promote our flexibility to reduce our worldwide effective Corporate tax rate. In addition, this new Corporate structure is generally more favor to expand our business through acquisitions in joint ventures.

With that, let me talk about -- there was a -- we were quoted yesterday in Reuters, and I think the lead part of the article was Noble says we're in for a rough year. For those of you that have read it, you needed -- the headline was really taken out of context. What I was saying that -- that clearly, with the possibility of an invasion of Iraq and given the political situation in Venezuela, that this could indeed be a challenging and rough year for the whole industry. We feel very comfortable with first call consensus, as we speak. But this is not a lay-down year. And I also made a comment in our news release that pronouncements by other in the drilling service sector that things are really starting to go up, I think -- I don't want anybody to jump off and believe that the turn has occurred. Fully -- anyone that's been involved with this industry over any length of time fully realizes that they're also going to be surprises. While yes, the Gulf of Mexico has started to improve, there are other areas that could be -- hold surprises. So don't -- don't jump on the hyperbole and think things have turned the corner. Without questioning what is going on [INAUDIBLE] Gulf of Mexico. We are saying improvement in in dayrates for jackups. Last recall from the last conference call, I indicated that what I did like at that point, it appeared dayrates were stopped falling. Right now, the first indication that dayrates are starting to improve. Now, they aren't -- they aren't running straight up, but we are seeing a thousand dollars here, three or four thousand dollars there. So that's a positive. Mexico continues to be rather slow in making commitments on rigs. They currently have plans for four additional rigs. They can either be MAP rigs or Independent Leg Cantilever rigs. They also have a need for one 300-foot jackup, in addition to the four, and after that we understand at some time in May, first of June, they'll have a requirement for a 350-foot independently cantilever jackup. So that process is still going. As we have indicated previously, that's a positive sign for the U.S. Gulf. Whenever it occurs we'll tighten the market in the U.S. Gulf, so we're very encouraged about that market. Hope to have additional units down before they're in. There's a possibility later in the year for in fact a semi, so you may also see a semi move out of the Gulf of Mexico. Venezuela, I don't need to spend a lot of time there. That was the quickest -- in reversal that in history of that sort of thing. As all of you are aware, we like that area. We like the geology in the lake. But I've also moved all of our rigs out quite some time ago because of the rather unusual political situation down there. I don't see any real help in Venezuela as far as taking rigs out of the Gulf of Mexico at this point in time. Brazil, Brazil continues to hold steady. Our operations continue there. We will in the second quarter pull one of our drill ships, The Leo, to do some upgrades to its drilling systems, so it will be down for a period. We don't see any need right now for additional semis. There has some discussion about jackups in Brazil, and we'll see if that develops later in the year. West Africa continues to be reasonably strong. We believe that there's -- will be an opportunity for a semi submersible and a jackup to go to that operating area. Hopefully, before year-end. So that's a positive sign. More than likely, they would be coming out of the Gulf Coast marine area, although it's possible that one jackup may come out of the North Sea. The North Sea is the weak sister, if you will. Internationally. Our competitors don't seem to learn that moving rigs on speck into a fully utilized market causes dayrate softening. I hope you write a book about that. And they tried to show the importance of demand and supply and that excess supply is going to kill demand, and dayrates, and -- but they don't seem to understand that. And there's some -- there's three idle rigs over there, and look for third, fourth quarter dayrates for jackups that are being rolled over to come down. If nothing else points to the importance of consolidation, it's the speculative move of rigs around the world. Middle East continues to be reasonably good. We obviously are concerned about the environment in the Middle East. I think most of you read some recent pronouncements by the leadership of Saudi Arabia about using oil as a political tool, a punitive tool. That is not good news. Obviously, the continued discussion about invasion of Iraq is not good news. But right now, things are reasonably subtle. Operations are going well. We've had no interruptions. East Coast of Canada, Hibernia, continues to operate, nothing to talk about there in terms of expansion at this point. The rigs in China, the idle rigs that we have recently bought, the Bingo 9,000 units and the Day Beard, Freeman Goldman semi-submersible, we're not doing anything on them at this point, but once the repurchase option expires, we will begin doing engineering and prepare for upgrading the two latter acquisitions. Let me talk about technology briefly. We have a lot of interest in our Alreiser. We're approximately 70% through our first complete production for our alloy reiser. And it's either en route or will be en route to Brazil in short order. And so that's going well, the manufacturing process. We will continue to manufacture additional strings and utilize them on other rigs in our fleet to take them into deeper water, more cost effectively than others using steel reiser. Once we get through with supplying, we will allow this technology to be licensed by others, and if so, we hope principally as production reiser which will will be a great market for. We have or will be making some announcements over the next 30 days on small acquisitions of technology. They're not big-dollar acquisitions, but we believe -- we're very optimistic they will have a nice impact on results in 2003 and 2004. Terms of our proprietary design Drill-Smart tool, I think we have 10 or -- nine or 10 units out. We will be staffing up hopefully over the next three to four quarters to increase the number of units we have out, not only on our fleet but on others around the world. Let me talk briefly about the two units that we recently bought from one of our competitors. They are now in the ship yard. We're assessing the amount of work that needs to be done on the units. What we will be doing as we previously announced is spending anywhere from 25 to $35 million, increasing the quarters. The quarters were not in Noble shape for our personnel, and we will completely renovate the quarters and actually increase the number of personnel that can live on them, from 80 to 110 to 120. We'll also work on the BOP handling system that the units had an antiquated system, and we'll bring them in line with our more technologically advanced systems on our EBA's. And we'll also stretch the units in terms of water depth, hopefully get them up to 4,000 feet, and perhaps up to 6,000 feet. We have interestingly enough completed previous engineering on similar designs to take them to 10,000 feet, so we know it can be done. It's obviously more money, but right now we're just targeting 4,000 feet. With that, I am confident that at this point, bargain some major surprising, that first call estimates are achievable by Noble. We're going to keep focused as we have in times past, and try to continue to lead this sector with returns on capitol and shareholder appreciation. I will now open the call to any questions you might have.\",\n",

We just happen to believe near-term this our clients are more interested in very uniquely designed and engineered deepwater units. Now, I know others have said there is not a need for any more deepwater units. I would agree with that, in general. But I certainly wouldn't be -- if I had a large number of drillships, which are principally exploratory tools, I wouldn't feel good about the future of deepwater. There's way too much capacity brought in too quick, and that's the reason we didn't chase that market. I mean, there was a strategic reason for Noble not running at that, even though we had a great infrastructure. The future will be in the developmental type applications. With uniquely designed semis that have good motion characteristics, stay on location, and not cost an arm and a leg to operate, which the ships certainly are quite expensive. I know there's been some disappointments. In that intermediate depth of deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico, and there's been some disappointment in Brazil. But there's still a lot of interest in talking to the majors in deepwater and the Gulf of Mexico. And you know them. And -- so we're still encouraged about it. We're not talking about slugging the market with a half dozen rigs. What we're doing, as you're aware, with the Boudreaux is doing a preliminary steelwork for that unit to work in the Golden Triangle. We didn't talk about West Africa, but West Africa -- I mean, you can argue there's been some near-term disappointment there, but not substantial amount of disappointment, and there's still very excited about the geology in West Africa. So would I be [INAUDIBLE] I had a bunch of drillships just built, worrying about deepwater markets? You bet.

Even with one of the rigs dropping from 40 into the mid-30s. That's a pretty healthy uptake for a market that's not as well utilized as Gulf of Mexico is. In fact, it just went back and looked at stats on this and it was November to December '99 that we saw the last time we saw a move similar to that. I guess what I want to try to do is reconcile comments that you made in the press release and comments made on this call with a data point, such as that. Pretty decent movement in the average rate structure for those rigs. Could we be an influx -- inflection point it's late '99ish that we'll see in the Gulf or as you pointed out in your comments, stall out here for a little while?\",\n",

And what I don't -- being the young man that you are, and you know all the scars that I've had, every time that I think I understand something, even the number of years I've been in this business, I get surprised. I don't believe -- here's the problem, as you know on the shelf in the u.S. Gulf. Unless you're going deep, and the deeper projects, deep gas on the shelf, the smaller reservoirs that all the independents experience are very price-sensitive to dayrates some we might have -- in other words, you might have these movements offered a low of 11, 12, 13%, that look like nice. It's that movement off of a -- the next high, the next leg up, that we'll start encountering some pressure. So the fact that the majority of the projects on the shelf, shallow water, shallow formations, gas driven, are so price sensitive, I think you're going to run into some head wind later in the year.

It could be a turnaround. We could see some softening. Let's assume one or two rigs move out of the North Sea, then you change the completion of that. It's that one rigor two rigs that sits around that the operators know how to play the game. And so yes, it could be a reasonably quick turnaround. And our marketing people have done a -- have really performed very well over the terms of dayrates. But I think it also is reflective of -- to Mark's point, we stayed in our little neck of the woods, and tried to elbow everybody else out, and we've also had -- we have a great operating reputation there.

Jim, what do you trying to accomplish on the technology side in terms of short and long-term thoughts there? And number two, is there a potential for you to make a more dramatic acquisition on that side of the business?\",\n",
       " 'James Day,    [94]',\n",
       " \"I'll answer them in reverse order. Yes, there could be dramatic -- let me define that. I'm not talking about -- I want to put a bracket around that -- dramatic could be four or 500 million dollar acquisition, something that of. Could question we're do that? Yes. Have we looked at it? Yes. The numbers haven't worked yet. But they might. So yes, we could step up. I'm not talking about dramatic in terms of two or 3 billion dollars. At least at this point. But there are some small intermediate type companies like that that make sense. Now, the acquisitions I alluded to accumulatively would be less than 20 million dollars we're currently talking about. So I'll give you an order of magnitude. And where are we going? I believe that dayrates, particularly deepwater, highly technical drilling, will go back up. And I know everyone on the phone hopes that they will go back up. But I think that as they start reaching back to -- reaching their old levels or surpassing them, that our clients -- and if you remember, I have representatives from Shell, BP, and independent called Kerm, GE, on my Board. And what I can say is people will demand more than just a trialer showing up on location with his drilling rig and saying, what do you want me to do? They're going to demand more, greater abilities in terms of technology. They're going to be more demanding on operating efficiencies. They're going to be more demanding of our people in terms of providing guidance and assistance. This whole period that we went through when everybody was saying, boy, look at the drillers, they're automatically going to this theoretical replacement dayrates, without providing anything for the clients. You've heard me say this before, it's silly. And in order for us to have these dayrates keep action system rating, we have to provide additional services. What we are doing with the technology, we're taking technology that can part of it be developed from within, with internal expertise, and we're going to marry that with unique technologies that are external and that really add to our efficiencies on our rigs. We're going to apply our Drill-Smart tool. We're going to be our rigs coming out the Boudreaux and others will have -- will be classified as a smart rig, which is -- has a whole variety of sensing systems, predictive systems, systems that make our drillers and rig managers more efficient. And we think that's got for part and parcel of what the future holds. Showing up, charging something a dayrate, and thinking that's going to suffice is silly. And the market shouldn't buy it either.\",\n",

       " \"Two more follow-ups. One, related to that, is the thought process at all try to create a more stable earnings basis? Frankly, you've done a pretty good job with long-term contracts, and creating pretty stable earnings base relative to your pierce. And the second is talking about smart rigs. Here's a dumb question. Do you in terms of your competition, who do you think your competition is going forward? Is it Global Santa Fe, Transocean, or is it now somebody else in terms of service companies?\",\n",
       " 'James Day,    [96]',\n",
       " \"No, those are great questions. You always have great questions. As you know, the backup give a little history, when we were acquiring different companies and we were attempting to set up benchmarks on how good we were, relative to our peer group, all the drillers had a tendency so to say we're the best guy in the world, but the reality is there's no benchmark that anybody used. We typically were dealing with personalities more than anything else. And Triton was a wonderful -- has been and will be a wonderful tool for us to measure what we did relative to our peer group because they used all of our peer groups' assets. So the first thing we did is set benchmarks and then we're really competing against ourselves in many -- in many regions. We can show our benchmark is -- and the results we achieve is far superior to any of the companies you alluded to. The other thing that -- it's not just operational. It's engineering. As you know, we have created a tremendous amount of value, as you know because you've been down to see the assets, of doing engineering and commissioning of our rigs and such a manner that we far exceeded any returns that our competitors will ever achieve. Some of the massive overruns by some of the companies you alluded to, they will never achieve a return on capital. The units at some point in my mind will have to be written down. So -- not to sound too boastful because we're not that way, but we don't look at the other drillers in and of themselves, anyone that you talked about, as competitors. They have drilling assets that will -- that we look at that -- from a design standpoint are interesting. But across the board, we really don't look at them as our major competitors. It's usually individual drilling assets. In terms of the technology giving us a more stable earnings base, I do appreciate your comment about we have done a reasonably good job. I think we've done a great job, on having steady earnings. I know there's a lot of discussion about long-term contracts, but I think the market today has fully appreciated was we were trying to do, and will do, selectively in the future. The technology can provide a different earnings base. For example, with the aluminum -- with the alloy riser, if we use that in a production mode, our clients will be the Shell's, the BP's, the objects of this world, and that will be a market that will be very unique. It will meet not too far afield from what we do, but a new, unique market. And what's wonderful about that, that is the latter part of the developmental mode. We go out and drill the wells. Then they start developing it. If he use tools of ours to do that, that just extends our exposure to the well bore. And so yes, this technology can provide some additional stability.\",\n",

Current results,$3.3 million for costs associated with the tax inversion and included in general and [INAUDIBLE] expense. The expense going forward approximate 6.5 million per quarter. Overall, our utilization dropped 1% to 86% in the first quarter this year. And reduced revenues by 1 million. This was offset by an increase in our dayrates to 62,700 per day, 2,000 more per day than last year, which added an addition at $2.8 million to our revenues. Operating costs in line with the fourth quarter, for Corporate effective tax rate, dropped to 17%, which reflects the mix and earnings being driven by international and the first quarter. Our tax rate should move closer to 20%. One last comment on the income statement. Included in other income expense, two gains. A 5.9 million dollar gain on the sale of our working interests in Falcon Prospect to Pioneer, and a 4 million dollar gain from the receipt of tax payments made in Canada related to the Bowden acquisition. We reclassify in the decline in our ocean rig stocks from temperature to permanent, which reduced the previously mentioned gains by 9.8 million you are. Our cash flow of $95 million funded 40 million of normal expenditures, with the remaining going to fund the previously disclosed acquisitions.

We elected two Directors to the Class of Directors for a three-year term, expiring in 2005. Approved amendments to two of our stock option plans. And also increased our authorized shares of capital stock from 200 million shares to 400 million shares, which will be available for issuance for proper Corporate purposes, without further shareholder action. With respect to our proposal to restructure our operations, we had an overwhelming endorsement of that proposal by our stockholders. Holders of 96.4% of the shares voting on the restructuring, voted in favor of the adoption. This will enable us to restructure so that our place of incorporation will be moved from Delaware to the Cayman Islands. The merger is scheduled to become effective after the close of business on April 30, 2002. And we will continue trading our stock under -- on the New York Stock Exchange, no changes in our trade simple, and stockholders will not have to do anything with respect to their certificates either. Just a couple of other comments on the restructuring to move our parent company, Noble Corporate Group, offshore. Our international operations accounted for 54% of our total operations in 2001 and 67% in the first quarter of this year. Net income attributable to our international operations during such periods was a higher percentage, and I think as everyone knows over 60% of our fleet of offshore assets are deployed into international markets. With our operations in the Gulf of Mexico, obviously, we will continue to pay U.S. taxes. But our new structure will promote our flexibility to reduce our worldwide effective Corporate tax rate. In addition, this new Corporate structure is generally more favor to expand our business through acquisitions in joint ventures. In the absence of the U.S. tax code that is more on a level playing field, the current tax system perhaps unwittingly could promote foreign takeovers of U.S. companies. As a leading provider of diversified service to the oil and gas industry, we're engaged in a global business with global competitive forces, and our Board of Directors yesterday our stockholders concur that they want us to remain competitive in the global marketplace. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Jim.\",\n",

       " \"Thank you, Bob. Before I start talking about activity, our activities around the world, I would add to what Bob said. We had very few comments from shareholders. I think there were a total of approximately 18 calls that we received. Once we explained why we were trying to make sure we remain competitive and that [INAUDIBLE] they all were in favor of the resolution to move overseas. I did receive two letters, is all, and again, most of them -- the two were under the impression that we were not going to pay any U.S. taxes, that the Officers were not going to pay any U.S. taxes, that somehow we would escape any exposure to U.S. taxes. And we tried to and did explain to them that we're going to continue to pay U.S. taxes on U.S. earned income, and that all we're trying to do is assure we remain competitive with our two largest competitors, Global Santa Fe and Transocean. With that, let me talk about -- there was a -- we were quoted yesterday in Reuters, and I think the lead part of the article was Noble says we're in for a rough year. For those of you that have read it, you needed -- the headline was really taken out of context. What I was saying that -- that clearly, with the possibility of an invasion of Iraq and given the political situation in Venezuela, that this could indeed be a challenging and rough year for the whole industry. We feel very comfortable with first call consensus, as we speak. But this is not a lay-down year. And I also made a comment in our news release that pronouncements by other in the drilling service sector that things are really starting to go up, I think -- I don't want anybody to jump off and believe that the turn has occurred. Fully -- anyone that's been involved with this industry over any length of time fully realizes that they're also going to be surprises. While yes, the Gulf of Mexico has started to improve, there are other areas that could be -- hold surprises. So don't -- don't jump on the hyperbole and think things have turned the corner. Without questioning what is going on [INAUDIBLE] Gulf of Mexico. We are saying improvement in in dayrates for jackups. Last recall from the last conference call, I indicated that what I did like at that point, it appeared dayrates were stopped falling. Right now, the first indication that dayrates are starting to improve. Now, they aren't -- they aren't running straight up, but we are seeing a thousand dollars here, three or four thousand dollars there. So that's a positive. Mexico continues to be rather slow in making commitments on rigs. They currently have plans for four additional rigs. They can either be MAP rigs or Independent Leg Cantilever rigs. They also have a need for one 300-foot jackup, in addition to the four, and after that we understand at some time in May, first of June, they'll have a requirement for a 350-foot independently cantilever jackup. So that process is still going. As we have indicated previously, that's a positive sign for the U.S. Gulf. Whenever it occurs we'll tighten the market in the U.S. Gulf, so we're very encouraged about that market. Hope to have additional units down before they're in. There's a possibility later in the year for in fact a semi, so you may also see a semi move out of the Gulf of Mexico. Venezuela, I don't need to spend a lot of time there. That was the quickest -- in reversal that in history of that sort of thing. As all of you are aware, we like that area. We like the geology in the lake. But I've also moved all of our rigs out quite some time ago because of the rather unusual political situation down there. I don't see any real help in Venezuela as far as taking rigs out of the Gulf of Mexico at this point in time. Brazil, Brazil continues to hold steady. Our operations continue there. We will in the second quarter pull one of our drill ships, The Leo, to do some upgrades to its drilling systems, so it will be down for a period. We don't see any need right now for additional semis. There has some discussion about jackups in Brazil, and we'll see if that develops later in the year. West Africa continues to be reasonably strong. We believe that there's -- will be an opportunity for a semi submersible and a jackup to go to that operating area. Hopefully, before year-end. So that's a positive sign. More than likely, they would be coming out of the Gulf Coast marine area, although it's possible that one jackup may come out of the North Sea. The North Sea is the weak sister, if you will. Internationally. Our competitors don't seem to learn that moving rigs on speck into a fully utilized market causes dayrate softening. I hope you write a book about that. And they tried to show the importance of demand and supply and that excess supply is going to kill demand, and dayrates, and -- but they don't seem to understand that. And there's some -- there's three idle rigs over there, and look for third, fourth quarter dayrates for jackups that are being rolled over to come down. If nothing else points to the importance of consolidation, it's the speculative move of rigs around the world. Middle East continues to be reasonably good. We obviously are concerned about the environment in the Middle East. I think most of you read some recent pronouncements by the leadership of Saudi Arabia about using oil as a political tool, a punitive tool. That is not good news. Obviously, the continued discussion about invasion of Iraq is not good news. But right now, things are reasonably subtle. Operations are going well. We've had no interruptions. East Coast of Canada, Hibernia, continues to operate, nothing to talk about there in terms of expansion at this point. The rigs in China, the idle rigs that we have recently bought, the Bingo 9,000 units and the Day Beard, Freeman Goldman semi-submersible, we're not doing anything on them at this point, but once the repurchase option expires, we will begin doing engineering and prepare for upgrading the two latter acquisitions. Let me talk about technology briefly. We have a lot of interest in our Alreiser. We're approximately 70% through our first complete production for our alloy reiser. And it's either en route or will be en route to Brazil in short order. And so that's going well, the manufacturing process. We will continue to manufacture additional strings and utilize them on other rigs in our fleet to take them into deeper water, more cost effectively than others using steel reiser. Once we get through with supplying, we will allow this technology to be licensed by others, and if so, we hope principally as production reiser which will will be a great market for. We have or will be making some announcements over the next 30 days on small acquisitions of technology. They're not big-dollar acquisitions, but we believe -- we're very optimistic they will have a nice impact on results in 2003 and 2004. Terms of our proprietary design Drill-Smart tool, I think we have 10 or -- nine or 10 units out. We will be staffing up hopefully over the next three to four quarters to increase the number of units we have out, not only on our fleet but on others around the world. Let me talk briefly about the two units that we recently bought from one of our competitors. They are now in the ship yard. We're assessing the amount of work that needs to be done on the units. What we will be doing as we previously announced is spending anywhere from 25 to $35 million, increasing the quarters. The quarters were not in Noble shape for our personnel, and we will completely renovate the quarters and actually increase the number of personnel that can live on them, from 80 to 110 to 120. We'll also work on the BOP handling system that the units had an antiquated system, and we'll bring them in line with our more technologically advanced systems on our EBA's. And we'll also stretch the units in terms of water depth, hopefully get them up to 4,000 feet, and perhaps up to 6,000 feet. We have interestingly enough completed previous engineering on similar designs to take them to 10,000 feet, so we know it can be done. It's obviously more money, but right now we're just targeting 4,000 feet. With that, I am confident that at this point, bargain some major surprising, that first call estimates are achievable by Noble. We're going to keep focused as we have in times past, and try to continue to lead this sector with returns on capitol and shareholder appreciation. I will now open the call to any questions you might have.\",\n",

It's like Mexico, we're still believing we will get our share down there, even though it's a little slower than we think. West Africa is no different.\",\n",

       " \"Good morning, gentlemen. Jim, I'd like to get your thoughts on where you see the deepwater going over the next -- the course of 2002 and maybe into 2003. You know, clearly, a lot of people are hearing about the lack of success in the Gulf of Mexico. Lack of success in Brazil. And yet you guys continue to put more capital, it looks like, into that deepwater market and into the jackup rigs.\",\n",

       " \"If I could find -- Ken, as you heard me say before, it's been suggested we get completely out of the jackup business and the future as deepwater, 24 months ago. Now at once, everybody understood my strategy of having a balanced operation. If we could find opportunistic jackup purchases, we would do it. 300-foot jackups. We till like jackups. We just happen to believe near-term this our clients are more interested in very uniquely designed and engineered deepwater units. Now, I know others have said there is not a need for any more deepwater units. I would agree with that, in general. But I certainly wouldn't be -- if I had a large number of drillships, which are principally exploratory tools, I wouldn't feel good about the future of deepwater. There's way too much capacity brought in too quick, and that's the reason we didn't chase that market. I mean, there was a strategic reason for Noble not running at that, even though we had a great infrastructure. The future will be in the developmental type applications. With uniquely designed semis that have good motion characteristics, stay on location, and not cost an arm and a leg to operate, which the ships certainly are quite expensive. I know there's been some disappointments. In that intermediate depth of deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico, and there's been some disappointment in Brazil. But there's still a lot of interest in talking to the majors in deepwater and the Gulf of Mexico. And you know them. And -- so we're still encouraged about it. We're not talking about slugging the market with a half dozen rigs. What we're doing, as you're aware, with the Boudreaux is doing a preliminary steelwork for that unit to work in the Golden Triangle. We didn't talk about West Africa, but West Africa -- I mean, you can argue there's been some near-term disappointment there, but not substantial amount of disappointment, and there's still very excited about the geology in West Africa. So would I be [INAUDIBLE] I had a bunch of drillships just built, worrying about deepwater markets? You bet. Very unique semis that are designed and engineered specifically for application by certain operators, I think we -- we've been able to find those initials with our equipment and have very close relationship with operators, and I believe we'll be able to do that in the future as well.\",\n",

I mean, there's some really horse stories on equipment failure. The other side of it, I guess in that same vein, some of the majors short of people. I know that one of [INAUDIBLE] trying to move projects alone, if you visited with the staff, they do not have the staff to keep these projects moving. So I think it's personnel constraints. And the other, as far as the geological disappointment, there has been some, but we have interesting opportunities. People like Kerr-McGee, smaller people like Murphy. Those folks have all been -- done reasonably well, and there's others want to go get in it. There's some independents trying to buy properties we're aware of right now, and in fact -- Mr. Jackson alluded to the sale of some of our interests.

I guess what I want to try to do is reconcile comments that you made in the press release and comments made on this call with a data point, such as that.

I'm not talking about -- I want to put a bracket around that -- dramatic could be four or 500 million dollar acquisition, something that of. Could question we're do that? Yes. Have we looked at it? Yes. The numbers haven't worked yet. But they might. So yes, we could step up. I'm not talking about dramatic in terms of two or 3 billion dollars. At least at this point. But there are some small intermediate type companies like that that make sense. Now, the acquisitions I alluded to accumulatively would be less than 20 million dollars we're currently talking about. So I'll give you an order of magnitude. And where are we going? I believe that dayrates, particularly deepwater, highly technical drilling, will go back up. And I know everyone on the phone hopes that they will go back up. But I think that as they start reaching back to -- reaching their old levels or surpassing them, that our clients -- and if you remember, I have representatives from Shell, BP, and independent called Kerm, GE, on my Board. And what I can say is people will demand more than just a trialer showing up on location with his drilling rig and saying, what do you want me to do? They're going to demand more, greater abilities in terms of technology. They're going to be more demanding on operating efficiencies. They're going to be more demanding of our people in terms of providing guidance and assistance. This whole period that we went through when everybody was saying, boy, look at the drillers, they're automatically going to this theoretical replacement dayrates, without providing anything for the clients. You've heard me say this before, it's silly. And in order for us to have these dayrates keep action system rating, we have to provide additional services. What we are doing with the technology, we're taking technology that can part of it be developed from within, with internal expertise, and we're going to marry that with unique technologies that are external and that really add to our efficiencies on our rigs. We're going to apply our Drill-Smart tool. We're going to be our rigs coming out the Boudreaux and others will have -- will be classified as a smart rig, which is -- has a whole variety of sensing systems, predictive systems, systems that make our drillers and rig managers more efficient. And we think that's got for part and parcel of what the future holds. Showing up, charging something a dayrate, and thinking that's going to suffice is silly.

Frankly, you've done a pretty good job with long-term contracts, and creating pretty stable earnings base relative to your pierce. And the second is talking about smart rigs. Here's a dumb question. Do you in terms of your competition, who do you think your competition is going forward? Is it Global Santa Fe, Transocean, or is it now somebody else in terms of service companies?\",\n",
       " 'James Day,    [96]',\n",
       " \"No, those are great questions. You always have great questions. As you know, the backup give a little history, when we were acquiring different companies and we were attempting to set up benchmarks on how good we were, relative to our peer group, all the drillers had a tendency so to say we're the best guy in the world, but the reality is there's no benchmark that anybody used. We typically were dealing with personalities more than anything else. And Triton was a wonderful -- has been and will be a wonderful tool for us to measure what we did relative to our peer group because they used all of our peer groups' assets. So the first thing we did is set benchmarks and then we're really competing against ourselves in many -- in many regions. We can show our benchmark is -- and the results we achieve is far superior to any of the companies you alluded to. The other thing that -- it's not just operational. It's engineering. As you know, we have created a tremendous amount of value, as you know because you've been down to see the assets, of doing engineering and commissioning of our rigs and such a manner that we far exceeded any returns that our competitors will ever achieve. Some of the massive overruns by some of the companies you alluded to, they will never achieve a return on capital. The units at some point in my mind will have to be written down. So -- not to sound too boastful because we're not that way, but we don't look at the other drillers in and of themselves, anyone that you talked about, as competitors. They have drilling assets that will -- that we look at that -- from a design standpoint are interesting. But across the board, we really don't look at them as our major competitors. It's usually individual drilling assets. In terms of the technology giving us a more stable earnings base, I do appreciate your comment about we have done a reasonably good job. I think we've done a great job, on having steady earnings. I know there's a lot of discussion about long-term contracts, but I think the market today has fully appreciated was we were trying to do, and will do, selectively in the future. The technology can provide a different earnings base. For example, with the aluminum -- with the alloy riser, if we use that in a production mode, our clients will be the Shell's, the BP's, the objects of this world, and that will be a market that will be very unique. It will meet not too far afield from what we do, but a new, unique market. And what's wonderful about that, that is the latter part of the developmental mode. We go out and drill the wells. Then they start developing it. If he use tools of ours to do that, that just extends our exposure to the well bore. And so yes, this technology can provide some additional stability.\",\n",

       "\"\\r\\nOperator   [1]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). One moment for your first question. Your first question comes from Duncan McKeen of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead, sir. Mr. McKeen?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Duncan McKeen,  Macquarie Capital Markets - Analyst   [2]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Sorry about that, operator, I'm here. Good morning. I missed what you had said on the cash cost guidance for South Inkai. I was wondering if you could just go through that again.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [3]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes, certainly, Duncan. What we said is that the cash cost per pound sold for next year, on average for 2009, is expected to be $28 per pound. The reason why it's initially higher is, obviously, as you ramp up production your cost per unit is higher, and that by the end of next year, 2009, we expect that cash cost to be in the $20 per pound range which starts approximating long-term parameters.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Duncan McKeen,  Macquarie Capital Markets - Analyst   [4]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n So you expect to stay at a level of about $20 on a go forward basis after 2010, as well?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [5]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n We are not giving guidance beyond 2009 but the $20 number will likely reduce a bit.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Duncan McKeen,  Macquarie Capital Markets - Analyst   [6]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Why are you seeing cash costs at Akdala increase up to $15 a pound in '09? Can you explain? My understanding was that acid prices in Kazakhstan were coming down, and also you're looking at adding the drying circuit which would potentially save $1.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [7]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes, but we also have inflation to take accounts [forward]. You just have a general inflation increase that leads to $15.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Duncan McKeen,  Macquarie Capital Markets - Analyst   [8]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Just one other question, if I could. With regards to the sulphuric acid in Kazakhstan, am I correct in understanding that it's not a production issue at all? It's a transportation issue regarding railcars. And is there something that can be done? Can you guys procure railcars yourselves to alleviate the bottleneck?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [9]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I'll tell you this, Duncan. We'll certainly be doing everything in our power to assist. It is primarily a logistical issue. But you can see the strategy is to get involved with getting closer to the production of sulphuric acid for our own account, and that certainly will be our strategy for the medium to long term.. We will be working on trying to get the numbers up because, as you would have seen, for example at South Inkai, we have enough drill holes in the grouped and we have a plant that's ready to produce more, so if we had sulphuric acid available we certainly would be able to push the production numbers.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Duncan McKeen,  Macquarie Capital Markets - Analyst   [10]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes, we could see the high production numbers that it was operating there in June. I will jump off and let somebody else go and hop back on later..\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [11]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Your next question comes from Adam Schatzker of RBC Capital Markets.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Adam Schatzker,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [12]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Good day, everyone. First, I just want to thank you for some excellent disclosure. It's refreshing to see such detailed disclosure. It makes our job quite a bit easier. First I was wondering if you could perhaps hold my hand through the production guidance change from the last presentation of 6.2 for 2009 to now what you have is 3.5. I think some of it has already been announced with, of course, Dominion and perhaps Palangana and Hobson and things like that. But if you could just hold my hand, it would be much appreciated.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [13]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Adam, I think the major issues that we indicated that Dominion were accounting for about 1.1 million pounds. We're obviously reducing the Texas number. The number you may be searching for is that our internal budget number for South Inkai for next year includes another 300,000 pounds worth of production, but we've decided to bring our guidance lower simply because of the sulphuric acid availability issue. So if you have that 300,000 pound number, you have the Dominion number and you have the Honeymoon number, then you've got -- obviously there is a little bit of Texas -- then you have the whole discrepancy.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Adam Schatzker,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [14]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n If I may ask a few more questions. The new contract you signed, I'm wondering if you can tell us the volumes and the duration. You said it starts in 2012. I'm just wondering if there is any volume help you can give us and how long it lasts.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [15]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n This is, unfortunately, a small market so we try and stay away from information like that. It becomes competitive level information. I would answer you in this way. Typically contracts for producers of our stature get signed for round about five years, and typically you start delivering two to three years out, and you typically see a normal US related inflation factor on top of those numbers. But more than that I can't tell you.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Adam Schatzker,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [16]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay, I'll have to respect that. The issues at Kharasan, I know you say it's well field maintenance. Maybe you could just describe a little more as to what that means. If that's a problem that cannot be resolved, what are the long-term implications? Would we see higher costs and lower production or how would that work itself out long-term?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Steve Magnuson,  Uranium One Inc. - COO   [17]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Adam, what we are seeing here, it's a basic clean up problem. It's a maintenance problem that is being addressed. When the wells were completed, they weren't adequately cleaned up so we weren't getting the flow rates. The situation was, we were not getting adequate flow rate into the plant. That's something that can be resolved. There is also an issue with the design of the well field. Spacing between wells was a little bit in excess. We are addressing that. So these are issues that we can address and I don't see long-term problems with it. Okay. And, if I may, two very quick questions here. There was discussion before, of course, about Kazakhstan and potential taxes and things like that. Any sign of light on those, or have they gone the way of the Dodo?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [18]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n No new information, Adam. What we've heard last time around is that taxes will be implemented effective the first of January. We have seen nothing, as we said, previously that leads us to believe at this time that our taxation position will worsen. If it worsens it won't be materially so. But we certainly don't have any new information to disclose.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Adam Schatzker,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [19]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n And lastly, if you could just let me know what your inventories of finished uranium are, if you can separate Kazakhstan versus corporate.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [20]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n That's set out in our MD&amp;A, Adam. We are just looking at the page for you. On page 21 you will find the breakdown.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Adam Schatzker,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [21]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay, sorry, I didn't see it there. Thanks very much.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [22]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Your next question comes from Orest Wowkodaw of Canaccord.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Orest Wowkodaw,  Cannacord Adams - Analyst   [23]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Hi, good morning. A couple of questions, if I may. The uranium contracts that you have where you mentioned 80% have a floor of around 40 or 45. Are there any ceilings attached to those contracts?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [24]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n We have one contract where we have a ceiling and this is a smaller volume contract of $100 per pound. On the remaining portion of the book we have no ceilings.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Orest Wowkodaw,  Cannacord Adams - Analyst   [25]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n You mentioned that you expect to receive your first dividend out of Kazakhstan this quarter. Is there anything that would make you think that there could be issues with getting that dividend at this point? Or you think that's a smooth type of payment?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [26]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n We definitely see it as a smooth payment. We've extended loans in Kazakhstan. We helped in one of the predecessor companies, Eurasia, build Akdala, and there was a learning to the Betpak Dala venture. That was fully repaid back to us. We [have loaned] -- the Kyzylkum joint venture to build the Kharasan mine. That is being repaid to us. So we've seen absolutely no cash flows coming out of Kazakhstan being ended, and we see no changes in the Kazakh situation that leads us to believe there will be any issues with receiving our [information]. The reason why we mention it is because we've had the questions, and, obviously, everyone would like to know where do we get our cash from.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Orest Wowkodaw,  Cannacord Adams - Analyst   [27]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Of your cash balance of $99 million, how much of that is sitting in Kazakhstan?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [28]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Of that portion, the attributable number that sits in the JVs are about just over $20 million. So a large portion of that is under our direct control in North America.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Orest Wowkodaw,  Cannacord Adams - Analyst   [29]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [30]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Your next question comes from Simon Tonkin of Thomas Weisel Partners.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Simon Tonkin,  Thomas Weisel Partners - Analyst   [31]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n First of all, thanks for your additional disclosure this quarter. First off, the question on Kazakhstan. They announced they were going to do 14% lower production in 2009. Does that affect you guys in any way?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [32]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Obviously when Kazatomprom discloses information it discloses it for the industry. So certainly the numbers you see on our side will be included in their numbers. Yes.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Simon Tonkin,  Thomas Weisel Partners - Analyst   [33]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n And just a second question. On the exchange rate, how do you see the Kazakh tenge affecting yourselves?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [34]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The Kazakh tenge has been very steady against the US dollar. I'm definitely not in the business of forecasting currencies, don't have the skills for that. At this time, in any case, we see it steady over the budget period which is three years. But, as I say, I'm not specialized on that question.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [35]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Your next question comes from Brian MacArthur of UBS Securities.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Brian MacArthur,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [36]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n You've given production guidance over the next two years. Can you give me if you expect your sales to match it that way? And you also talked about having 26 million pounds under contract. And I realize that it's somewhat of a competitive industry, you don't want to give away any business. Magnitude, how that breaks down over the next 3 or 4 years.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [37]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Brian, we obviously are not that aggressive in selling our book over the shorter term because we are ramping up quite a few of our assets. We don't want to be caught short the market. Having said that, even if we were caught short the market -- and we are not, let me just make that clear -- we do have a market related book, and that market related book means that we basically can go into the market, buy and deliver for very little discrepancy to our customers. Of the 26 million pounds that we have disclosed which is an attributable book, under 4 million pounds, just under 4 million pounds of that is a Dominion related book. We have said that previously. So 22-odd million pounds, Kazakh related sales. Now those sales go out over the next 8 years. Some of it is delivering in the shorter term, some of it is delivery over the longer term. I'll tell you this. We are under committed over the next two or three years with regards to our production, and the further you go out the lower the percentage becomes. I can't tell you more than that.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Brian MacArthur,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [38]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n That's very helpful. That's what I was after. The second issue, just for, obviously South Inkai you expect to get commercial production next year and those pounds, theoretically, will be booked, I assume, to the income statement. I assume the Kharasan stuff, though, basically since you're not going to get the production license until 2010, that 200,000 pounds wouldn't be in sales next year?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [39]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Let's just be clear. We do expect South Inkai to be in commercial production next year. So you will see revenue and you'll see cost. But Kharasan, you're quite right, we only see that to be in commercial production in 2010, so that won't be affecting our income statement but it will be affecting our balance sheet.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Brian MacArthur,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [40]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Right, so sales for next year just really reflect the South Inkai, the Akdala and any inventory you move out effectively. (inaudible) that way.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [41]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n You're quite right. When you construct your income statement the Kharasan won't be showing there. But we will be producing the pounds.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Brian MacArthur,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [42]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you. One last question, if I could. Can you just give a magnitude -- in your foreclosure, obviously for South Inkai next year, you're ramping up production. I understand that. But just magnitude, sulphuric acid costs you factored in to that?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [43]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I don't have that number at my fingertips. I will call you back and let you have that number.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [44]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Your next question comes from Mitesh Thakkar, FBR Capital Markets.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Mitesh Thakkar,  FBR Capital Markets - Analyst   [45]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Hi, first a quick question on CapEx. I know you guys put in some numbers totaling less than $50 million something. I just wanted to understand in terms of Kharasan and South Inkai, pre-commercial production, you must be capitalizing the OpEx. So what would be the magnitude of that thing? And second thing is, you mentioned that you will not be required to contribute any CapEx for the Kazakhstan JVs. In terms of that, what would be the magnitude of that CapEx, even though I know it doesn't have to come through your cash? Thanks.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [46]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n At this stage we've chosen not to show all the detailed numbers with regard to CapEx in Kazakhstan. Obviously you can calculate the operating cost because we've given you an operating cost per pound and you can multiply that by the pounds sold. That will give you a very good indication. On the CapEx side, as I say, we don't have the numbers in yet. It's sufficient to say that Betpak Dala is producing sufficient profits to be able to incur all of the CapEx that's required. Most of the plants have been constructed so very little capital remaining on that side. So it's primarily well field development going forward.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Mitesh Thakkar,  FBR Capital Markets - Analyst   [47]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I'm sorry I missed on the OpEx part. You mentioned that one can calculate from the cash cost you have disclosed. But I think for '08 you have not disclosed any cash cost numbers for South Inkai, and similarly for Kharasan, as well.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [48]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n On the South Inkai side, we've indicated that for 2009 we expect the average cash costs to be $28 per pound, reducing to $20 per pound by the end of the year. On the Kharasan site, you're right, we did not disclose a cash cost number simply because we are still in construction, and we will be able to provide you that number when we get further into the construction period.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Mitesh Thakkar,  FBR Capital Markets - Analyst   [49]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n If I may, a quick follow up question on the sulphuric acid situation. How much of the additional sulphuric acid supply -- you may not be able to give me in terms of kgs and tons, but in percentage terms, how much more sulphuric acid supply you need from what your existing levels are to achieve your production guidance for '09 at Kharasan and South Inkai.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [50]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n We need to receive about 40% to 50% more than what we've received this year throughout 2009 to achieve our production guidance. We initially anticipated we would receive significantly more than that. But round about 40% to 50% more at South Inkai. On the Kharasan side, I think the major issues will be less sulphuric acid and more the issues that Steve was describing from a technical perspective to achieve the targets. So we're less worried about sulphuric acid at Kharasan.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Mitesh Thakkar,  FBR Capital Markets - Analyst   [51]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you very much, I really appreciate that.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [52]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Your next question comes from Shane Hunter of BJM.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Shane Hunter,  Barnard, Jacobs, Mellet - Analyst   [53]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Just a question, first of all, about Honeymoon, it has actually to do with costs. Just from the studies that you've done, are you able to give us an indication of what you expect for cost per pound production once it actually starts operating?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [54]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Shane, we've not established that because that's basically a 2010 number, so when we get to our next set of guidance we will obviously give you that number. Let me put it to you in this way. What we see in terms of the cash cost numbers in the current uranium market it certainly would be very profitable.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Shane Hunter,  Barnard, Jacobs, Mellet - Analyst   [55]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n In a similar vein, you've described what you expect to be the cash cost of South Inkai. And I know, notwithstanding the fact that you're obviously in a ramp up, they seem to be a bit higher than what you're getting from Akdala, so I'm just wondering in the long term, would you expect those two to be operating at the same cost or is there some sort of material aspect to the operation that you would expect to see the higher cost at South Inkai compared to Akdala?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Steve Magnuson,  Uranium One Inc. - COO   [56]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n South Inkai is a deeper deposit than Akdala so naturally you're going to incur higher costs because of the drilling component. So I would expect South Inkai to be marginally higher than Akdala.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Shane Hunter,  Barnard, Jacobs, Mellet - Analyst   [57]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Would it be a similar trend then for Kharasan?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Steve Magnuson,  Uranium One Inc. - COO   [58]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Kharasan is even deeper so you carry that forward and you will get a little bit higher costs in Kharasan than you would Akdala.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Shane Hunter,  Barnard, Jacobs, Mellet - Analyst   [59]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. I've just got a final question. I just noted from the MD&amp;A that you described that you had a loan agreement to borrow 200,000 pounds of uranium. But see you've got inventory of about 1 million pounds. So I just wondered if you could explain why you've got this loan?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [60]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The biggest -- we transport material quite far from Kazakhstan and South Africa to converters in North America. Sometimes you're in a position where your material may still be in the water. We are certainly building up our credibility with our customers and therefore we have determined not to deliver any of our material late, ever. So sometimes if you have material on the water on its way to a customer, then we will make use of the loan to deliver just to get over logistical issues we may have. As we build up our own inventory over the year to two years, we obviously will be able to give that loan back because then we'll be able to do it from internal sources. But while you're in a strong ramp-up mode, you don't want to disappoint your customers.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Shane Hunter,  Barnard, Jacobs, Mellet - Analyst   [61]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you that's all for me.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [62]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Your next question comes from David Talbot of Dundee Securities.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n David Talbot,  Dundee Capital Markets - Analyst   [63]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Good morning, gentlemen. I just have a question about Kharasan. Right now you're drilling out the Russian reserves. I'm just wondering how much impact this will be to year end resources, or at least how much of the reserve base you're testing. Would any such increase result in perhaps an expansion of the Kharasan plant going forward?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [64]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The Kharasan ore body is certainly a very large ore body, and we have got very high expectations of it. And certainly there are very real opportunities of expanding the plant in the future. At this time, the most important priority is to get it operating smoothly, so although we are drilling and I wouldn't be able to give you any specific numbers on this call with regards to the expansions we expect, there certainly is a very real opportunity somewhere in the future to expand the production of Kharasan.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n David Talbot,  Dundee Capital Markets - Analyst   [65]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The $29 million you have left in Aflease, how active are you at the disposing of this asset? And just a final question is what is your confidence on the industrial license for South Inkai? You still say year end revenue and costs starting in about January for that one.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [66]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n On Aflease site, the general market tick down has made it very difficult to sell any noncore assets. Aflease Gold, however, does remain a noncore asset and we will continue to focus on realizing that it's not our core business. But it's more difficult to get rid of assets in this economic environment, as you would understand.\\r\\n On the South Inkai side, we actually have had progress. The site committee for reserves have met. We're just waiting for final documentation to come back our way for us to be able to disclose it. We are very confident this time that we will receive that license before the end of the year.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n David Talbot,  Dundee Capital Markets - Analyst   [67]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you very much.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [68]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Your next question comes from Ralph Profiti of Credit Suisse.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Ralph Profiti,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [69]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thanks for taking my question. I just want to come back to the loan agreement. Did I hear you right that the counter party is an existing customer? Second question, how will be that accounted for and is the 200,000 pounds in one single tranche?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [70]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The loan agreement is with a, not an existing customer but what we anticipate will be a future customer. It's an entity we have a very high regard for and certainly would like to do business with. It's an Asian customer. We were very fortunate to get this loan agreement with them and improve our relationships on that. The 200,000 pounds is one tranche, you're quite right in asking that. I'll ask Robin just to answer the way we account for the loan.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Robin Merrifield,  Uranium One Inc. - CFO   [71]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Both as an asset and a liability and we mark to market the value at every quarter end. So it doesn't affect anything.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Ralph Profiti,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [72]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Can I assume you're only going to able to realize it in your sales book until the entire 200,000 pounds is sold?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [73]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n We don't expect to put that into our sales at all. As I explained earlier, Ralph, we actually anticipate using that material only to the extent that we need to get over logistical issues. We have material in the water and we've got delivery at the customer to make. What you see is, if you borrow, if you physically draw down on that borrowing, because at the moment it's just a facility, if you want. As we physically draw down on that borrowing and give it out to a customer, we'll obviously deliver back into that loan with a material that's on the water. You don't recognize the sale until the material that you have produced arrives at the converter.\\r\\n So it'll always just be a balance sheet item, as Robin says. You have an asset on the one hand, you have a liability on the other hand, and the sales only get recognized when your material gets delivered to a client.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [74]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Your next question comes from [Edward Sturk] of BMO Capital Markets.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Edward Sturk,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [75]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I've just got a couple questions on Dominion CapEx. What do you think your total CapEx for 2008 will be, and what's your expected CapEx for the next year? I know you disclosed what your CapEx expenditures (inaudible) but I just wanted a break down of that a year basis.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [76]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Edward, we haven't been focusing on the year backwards. I've been preparing for answers for next year. I will come back to you with the total CapEx number for the year. Obviously our number in the MD&amp;A shows that the development cost for the year has been $33.7 million, of which $13 million was spent in the third quarter. But I can't tell you exactly what we anticipated putting on the books for the fourth quarter which will give you the total number for [2008]. I didn't catch your second question.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Edward Sturk,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [77]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n It was basically just what your expected expenditure for next year will be at Dominion.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [78]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n We've been saying that our maintenance costs, we expect to be $12 million per annum. And we expect, it won't be false, that number.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Edward Sturk,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [79]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n And the $32 million closure costs, are they going to come this year or next?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [80]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Most of them will probably be incurred this quarter, although quite a bit of that may still be in the first quarter. It depends on how negotiations go.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Edward Sturk,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [81]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thanks very much.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [82]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Your next question comes from Bart Bart Jaworski of Raymond James.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bart Jawarski,  Raymond James Ltd. - Analyst   [83]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thanks, good morning. Just a question regarding the acid shortage in Kazakhstan. Is this going to be a shortage that's going to be evenly spread amongst all the producers in Kazakhstan, or is there one producer or a few producers which have priority access to the infrastructure?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [84]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bart, the way we understand it this is evenly spread amongst the industry. Which is why you will see that one of our friends, a Canadian fellow company, has made similar statements to what we have. And why the industry is generally down. But everything that we've seen, it's a general situation rather than just a very specific situation.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bart Jawarski,  Raymond James Ltd. - Analyst   [85]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n So is the Kazatomprom statement about 14% lower next year in terms of production related to this issue, or is there something else?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [86]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I haven't had a chance to check exactly why Kazatomprom reduced their numbers, so I won't speculate on their behalf.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bart Jawarski,  Raymond James Ltd. - Analyst   [87]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n If this is a new issue, what exactly happened to precipitate it from a few months ago where acid seemed to have been -- obviously we had supply come on, not the transportation issue, but --. Is there something that happened with the infrastructure over the last few months, which has precipitated the issue now?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [88]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes, Bart, I think we've been consistently saying that we see logistical issues as the major issue, production having largely been sorted out with the Balkhash plant being brought on line. The Balkhash plant is obviously still operating. What remains a concern is that in this general economic environment you may have reduced sulphuric acid production in times to come. We have seen none of that yet. But so that's why we continue to think with our work that it remains transportation and logistical issues. You simply have a larger volume of assets to move and you have to bring your rail costs back from very far ports to be able to deliver that asset. You have to maintain a fairly old fleet. (Inaudible) is in the process of being constructed. So it's largely logistical in nature.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bart Jawarski,  Raymond James Ltd. - Analyst   [89]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n And to overcome these issues, is that spending that you have to do or is that something that the government will have to do?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [90]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n It's spending that Kazatomprom and the distributors are incurring, not ourselves. But as I said earlier on the call, Bart, we recognize we have to get closer to sulphuric acid production ourselves, which is why we are investing in this plant at Zhanakorgan. It's certainly one of the largest driving forces in the production of uranium in the country of Kazakhstan.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bart Jawarski,  Raymond James Ltd. - Analyst   [91]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I just wanted to get a sense for how prolonged this issue could last, especially given lack of credit out there. Could this be a problem that lasts into 2010?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [92]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n There certainly are risks that could lead it to go beyond 2009. We think we have adequately discounted those risks in our guidance, but the world is a scary place at the moment.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Bart Jawarski,  Raymond James Ltd. - Analyst   [93]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thanks very much.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [94]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Your next question comes from David Snow of Energy Equities.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n David Snow,  Energy Equities - Analyst   [95]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Hello?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [96]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Hi, David.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n David Snow,  Energy Equities - Analyst   [97]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes, I'm trying to see is there a floor price in your new contract, the Asian contract?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [98]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n It's actually a base-escalated contract. So you use the price and then you add inflation to it. It doesn't have exposure to the upside nor to the downside. It's a fixed price with an escalation factor.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n David Snow,  Energy Equities - Analyst   [99]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I'm wondering what the price was in the general market at the time you did this.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [100]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n It was at $78 per pound. The uranium market at that time when we concluded the contract had similar contracts priced at $80 per pound. So we were about $2 off the market as one of the newer entrants to be able to sell a contract.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n David Snow,  Energy Equities - Analyst   [101]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. How much CapEx is involved in the Hobson deferral? It seems that was an easy one to push ahead but you deferred it. How much do you have left there that was an issue?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [102]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The full Hobson facility has been constructed so it's turning over the pumps and keeping it in good shape. We obviously have not incurred the well field development at La Palangana yet so the remaining CapEx, once we start up those operations, would be well field development CapEx costs. We don't have those numbers ready for you guys yet.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n David Snow,  Energy Equities - Analyst   [103]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n It seems like that would be a small amount of money involved to justify deferring it.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [104]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n There certainly are other areas in our business that would cause you more focused investigation than those costs. You're quite right.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n David Snow,  Energy Equities - Analyst   [105]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I don't see the logic of deferring if it's not a big CapEx item.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [106]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Well the logic is pretty simple. What you don't want to do is incur environmental liabilities in starting up an operation where you have a limited resource in the hope that you will get the rest of the resource drilled out by the time you start running out of resource. I think it's a prudent decision of saying we'd like to have enough resource for the whole thing to make sense by the time we start it up. So it's reducing our risks at the same time.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n David Snow,  Energy Equities - Analyst   [107]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n So you need more resource and a little more exploration to really feel confident in getting it going.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [108]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Exactly right.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n David Snow,  Energy Equities - Analyst   [109]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [110]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n At this time, we will take two more questions and then we will be done.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [111]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Your next question comes from Edward Sturk of BMO Capital Markets.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Edward Sturk,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [112]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Just a couple more questions on the acid costs -- the [aciding] in Kazakhstan. What's the cost per ton thrust at the moment? And then, once you have constructed your own acid plants where do you envisage sourcing the sulphur from?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Steve Magnuson,  Uranium One Inc. - COO   [113]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The last number I had heard it was in the range of near 200, 195, but it's ranged from 135 to 195. I can't tell you exactly where they are at right now. But that's normally where they are at.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [114]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n What was your second question.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Edward Sturk,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [115]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n When you constructed your acid plant where do you envisage getting your sulphur from?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [116]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The country of Kazakhstan, obviously, has quite a bit of sulphur available through the oil and gas industry so it's certainly not a limiting factor.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Edward Sturk,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [117]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Is that pure elemental sulphur, or are there any contaminants in there that might make it tricky to convert to acid?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Steve Magnuson,  Uranium One Inc. - COO   [118]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Our understanding is it's pure elemental sulphur without significant contaminants.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [119]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Your last question comes from Duncan McKeen, Macquarie Capital.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Duncan McKeen,  Macquarie Capital Markets - Analyst   [120]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I just wanted to ask one more question about Kharasan. You mentioned problems with restricted flow. I wanted to understand what you mean by that. You mentioned clean up as well. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on what is going on specifically at that well field.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Steve Magnuson,  Uranium One Inc. - COO   [121]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Once you complete a well, you will get some sand that comes in through the well bore, and you can get blockage that blocks the screen in the zone you're trying to inject into. You need to get in there and do some well clean up. You remove the sand and get it ready so it flows adequately. The flow rates we were encountering were only probably around one-fourth of what the well should have taken. So it's just a matter of getting another rig on top of that well, getting rid of that sand and debris prior to putting it into operation.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Duncan McKeen,  Macquarie Capital Markets - Analyst   [122]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n What's the process for getting rid of the sand? Do you literally send the drill pipe back down again to remove the sand?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Steve Magnuson,  Uranium One Inc. - COO   [123]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n That's one way to do it. You can put the drill pipe back in and you air lift it out and flush it out and it comes back up to the surface. Or you can put in a swabbing tool. That's what we do in the United States. That pulls it out. The idea is to get it up to the surface.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Duncan McKeen,  Macquarie Capital Markets - Analyst   [124]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n You mentioned the spacing as well. Is the spacing at Kharasan materially different from that at South Inkai?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Steve Magnuson,  Uranium One Inc. - COO   [125]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The initial pilot well field had spacing that was wider, meaning from injector producer was wider. We didn't feel it was an efficient way to extract the ore. We felt you needed to move in a little bit with your injectors just to get adequate sweeping of the ore body. That was somewhat different than South Inkai.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Duncan McKeen,  Macquarie Capital Markets - Analyst   [126]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The two JVs, are they essentially sharing information? The success of South Inkai and its performance, specifically this summer, are you sharing information between the JV partners so the other guys can glean from that at the Kharasan?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Steve Magnuson,  Uranium One Inc. - COO   [127]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Uranium One has experts on the ground, guys with 30-plus years experience in ISR mining that are there, and they're working with the Kyzylkum JV people and offering suggestions and following proven success at South Inkai project.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Duncan McKeen,  Macquarie Capital Markets - Analyst   [128]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Appreciate that, thanks, guys.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Jean Nortier,  Uranium One Inc. - Pres. and CEO   [129]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you very much, Duncan. Thank you everyone for joining us in our conference call this morning. We appreciate you taking the time out to listen to our conference call. Certainly if you have questions remaining, Chris and I are more than happy to answer the questions. Thank you for attending. Thank you, operator.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [130]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today.

Current results,$3.3 million for costs associated with the tax inversion and included in general and [INAUDIBLE] expense. The expense going forward approximate 6.5 million per quarter. Overall, our utilization dropped 1% to 86% in the first quarter this year. And reduced revenues by 1 million. This was offset by an increase in our dayrates to 62,700 per day, 2,000 more per day than last year, which added an addition at $2.8 million to our revenues. Operating costs in line with the fourth quarter, for Corporate effective tax rate, dropped to 17%, which reflects the mix and earnings being driven by international and the first quarter. Our tax rate should move closer to 20%. One last comment on the income statement. Included in other income expense, two gains. A 5.9 million dollar gain on the sale of our working interests in Falcon Prospect to Pioneer, and a 4 million dollar gain from the receipt of tax payments made in Canada related to the Bowden acquisition. We reclassify in the decline in our ocean rig stocks from temperature to permanent, which reduced the previously mentioned gains by 9.8 million you are. Our cash flow of $95 million funded 40 million of normal expenditures, with the remaining going to fund the previously disclosed acquisitions.

We elected two Directors to the Class of Directors for a three-year term, expiring in 2005. Approved amendments to two of our stock option plans. And also increased our authorized shares of capital stock from 200 million shares to 400 million shares, which will be available for issuance for proper Corporate purposes, without further shareholder action. With respect to our proposal to restructure our operations, we had an overwhelming endorsement of that proposal by our stockholders. Holders of 96.4% of the shares voting on the restructuring, voted in favor of the adoption. This will enable us to restructure so that our place of incorporation will be moved from Delaware to the Cayman Islands. The merger is scheduled to become effective after the close of business on April 30, 2002. And we will continue trading our stock under -- on the New York Stock Exchange, no changes in our trade simple, and stockholders will not have to do anything with respect to their certificates either. Just a couple of other comments on the restructuring to move our parent company, Noble Corporate Group, offshore. Our international operations accounted for 54% of our total operations in 2001 and 67% in the first quarter of this year. Net income attributable to our international operations during such periods was a higher percentage, and I think as everyone knows over 60% of our fleet of offshore assets are deployed into international markets. With our operations in the Gulf of Mexico, obviously, we will continue to pay U.S. taxes. But our new structure will promote our flexibility to reduce our worldwide effective Corporate tax rate. In addition, this new Corporate structure is generally more favor to expand our business through acquisitions in joint ventures. In the absence of the U.S. tax code that is more on a level playing field, the current tax system perhaps unwittingly could promote foreign takeovers of U.S. companies. As a leading provider of diversified service to the oil and gas industry, we're engaged in a global business with global competitive forces, and our Board of Directors yesterday our stockholders concur that they want us to remain competitive in the global marketplace.

       "  \"Thank you, Bob. Before I start talking about activity, our activities around the world, I would add to what Bob said. We had very few comments from shareholders. I think there were a total of approximately 18 calls that we received. Once we explained why we were trying to make sure we remain competitive and that [INAUDIBLE] they all were in favor of the resolution to move overseas. I did receive two letters, is all, and again, most of them -- the two were under the impression that we were not going to pay any U.S. taxes, that the Officers were not going to pay any U.S. taxes, that somehow we would escape any exposure to U.S. taxes. And we tried to and did explain to them that we're going to continue to pay U.S. taxes on U.S. earned income, and that all we're trying to do is assure we remain competitive with our two largest competitors, Global Santa Fe and Transocean. With that, let me talk about -- there was a -- we were quoted yesterday in Reuters, and I think the lead part of the article was Noble says we're in for a rough year. For those of you that have read it, you needed -- the headline was really taken out of context. What I was saying that -- that clearly, with the possibility of an invasion of Iraq and given the political situation in Venezuela, that this could indeed be a challenging and rough year for the whole industry. We feel very comfortable with first call consensus, as we speak. But this is not a lay-down year. And I also made a comment in our news release that pronouncements by other in the drilling service sector that things are really starting to go up, I think -- I don't want anybody to jump off and believe that the turn has occurred. Fully -- anyone that's been involved with this industry over any length of time fully realizes that they're also going to be surprises. While yes, the Gulf of Mexico has started to improve, there are other areas that could be -- hold surprises. So don't -- don't jump on the hyperbole and think things have turned the corner. Without questioning what is going on [INAUDIBLE] Gulf of Mexico. We are saying improvement in in dayrates for jackups. Last recall from the last conference call, I indicated that what I did like at that point, it appeared dayrates were stopped falling. Right now, the first indication that dayrates are starting to improve. Now, they aren't -- they aren't running straight up, but we are seeing a thousand dollars here, three or four thousand dollars there. So that's a positive. Mexico continues to be rather slow in making commitments on rigs. They currently have plans for four additional rigs. They can either be MAP rigs or Independent Leg Cantilever rigs. They also have a need for one 300-foot jackup, in addition to the four, and after that we understand at some time in May, first of June, they'll have a requirement for a 350-foot independently cantilever jackup. So that process is still going. As we have indicated previously, that's a positive sign for the U.S. Gulf. Whenever it occurs we'll tighten the market in the U.S. Gulf, so we're very encouraged about that market. Hope to have additional units down before they're in. There's a possibility later in the year for in fact a semi, so you may also see a semi move out of the Gulf of Mexico. Venezuela, I don't need to spend a lot of time there. That was the quickest -- in reversal that in history of that sort of thing. As all of you are aware, we like that area. We like the geology in the lake. But I've also moved all of our rigs out quite some time ago because of the rather unusual political situation down there. I don't see any real help in Venezuela as far as taking rigs out of the Gulf of Mexico at this point in time. Brazil, Brazil continues to hold steady. Our operations continue there. We will in the second quarter pull one of our drill ships, The Leo, to do some upgrades to its drilling systems, so it will be down for a period. We don't see any need right now for additional semis. There has some discussion about jackups in Brazil, and we'll see if that develops later in the year. West Africa continues to be reasonably strong. We believe that there's -- will be an opportunity for a semi submersible and a jackup to go to that operating area. Hopefully, before year-end. So that's a positive sign. More than likely, they would be coming out of the Gulf Coast marine area, although it's possible that one jackup may come out of the North Sea. The North Sea is the weak sister, if you will. Internationally. Our competitors don't seem to learn that moving rigs on speck into a fully utilized market causes dayrate softening. I hope you write a book about that. And they tried to show the importance of demand and supply and that excess supply is going to kill demand, and dayrates, and -- but they don't seem to understand that. And there's some -- there's three idle rigs over there, and look for third, fourth quarter dayrates for jackups that are being rolled over to come down. If nothing else points to the importance of consolidation, it's the speculative move of rigs around the world. Middle East continues to be reasonably good. We obviously are concerned about the environment in the Middle East. I think most of you read some recent pronouncements by the leadership of Saudi Arabia about using oil as a political tool, a punitive tool. That is not good news. Obviously, the continued discussion about invasion of Iraq is not good news. But right now, things are reasonably subtle. Operations are going well. We've had no interruptions. East Coast of Canada, Hibernia, continues to operate, nothing to talk about there in terms of expansion at this point. The rigs in China, the idle rigs that we have recently bought, the Bingo 9,000 units and the Day Beard, Freeman Goldman semi-submersible, we're not doing anything on them at this point, but once the repurchase option expires, we will begin doing engineering and prepare for upgrading the two latter acquisitions. Let me talk about technology briefly. We have a lot of interest in our Alreiser. We're approximately 70% through our first complete production for our alloy reiser. And it's either en route or will be en route to Brazil in short order. And so that's going well, the manufacturing process. We will continue to manufacture additional strings and utilize them on other rigs in our fleet to take them into deeper water, more cost effectively than others using steel reiser. Once we get through with supplying, we will allow this technology to be licensed by others, and if so, we hope principally as production reiser which will will be a great market for. We have or will be making some announcements over the next 30 days on small acquisitions of technology. They're not big-dollar acquisitions, but we believe -- we're very optimistic they will have a nice impact on results in 2003 and 2004. Terms of our proprietary design Drill-Smart tool, I think we have 10 or -- nine or 10 units out. We will be staffing up hopefully over the next three to four quarters to increase the number of units we have out, not only on our fleet but on others around the world. Let me talk briefly about the two units that we recently bought from one of our competitors. They are now in the ship yard. We're assessing the amount of work that needs to be done on the units. What we will be doing as we previously announced is spending anywhere from 25 to $35 million, increasing the quarters. The quarters were not in Noble shape for our personnel, and we will completely renovate the quarters and actually increase the number of personnel that can live on them, from 80 to 110 to 120. We'll also work on the BOP handling system that the units had an antiquated system, and we'll bring them in line with our more technologically advanced systems on our EBA's. And we'll also stretch the units in terms of water depth, hopefully get them up to 4,000 feet, and perhaps up to 6,000 feet. We have interestingly enough completed previous engineering on similar designs to take them to 10,000 feet, so we know it can be done. It's obviously more money, but right now we're just targeting 4,000 feet. With that, I am confident that at this point, bargain some major surprising, that first call estimates are achievable by Noble. We're going to keep focused as we have in times past, and try to continue to lead this sector with returns on capitol and shareholder appreciation. I will now open the call to any questions you might have.\"],\n",

Now at once, everybody understood my strategy of having a balanced operation. If we could find opportunistic jackup purchases, we would do it. 300-foot jackups. We till like jackups. We just happen to believe near-term this our clients are more interested in very uniquely designed and engineered deepwater units. Now, I know others have said there is not a need for any more deepwater units. I would agree with that, in general. But I certainly wouldn't be -- if I had a large number of drillships, which are principally exploratory tools, I wouldn't feel good about the future of deepwater. There's way too much capacity brought in too quick, and that's the reason we didn't chase that market. I mean, there was a strategic reason for Noble not running at that, even though we had a great infrastructure. The future will be in the developmental type applications. With uniquely designed semis that have good motion characteristics, stay on location, and not cost an arm and a leg to operate, which the ships certainly are quite expensive.

I'm not talking about -- I want to put a bracket around that -- dramatic could be four or 500 million dollar acquisition, something that of. Could question we're do that? Yes. Have we looked at it? Yes. The numbers haven't worked yet. But they might. So yes, we could step up. I'm not talking about dramatic in terms of two or 3 billion dollars. At least at this point. But there are some small intermediate type companies like that that make sense. Now, the acquisitions I alluded to accumulatively would be less than 20 million dollars we're currently talking about. So I'll give you an order of magnitude. And where are we going? I believe that dayrates, particularly deepwater, highly technical drilling, will go back up. And I know everyone on the phone hopes that they will go back up. But I think that as they start reaching back to -- reaching their old levels or surpassing them, that our clients -- and if you remember, I have representatives from Shell, BP, and independent called Kerm, GE, on my Board. And what I can say is people will demand more than just a trialer showing up on location with his drilling rig and saying, what do you want me to do? They're going to demand more, greater abilities in terms of technology. They're going to be more demanding on operating efficiencies. They're going to be more demanding of our people in terms of providing guidance and assistance. This whole period that we went through when everybody was saying, boy, look at the drillers, they're automatically going to this theoretical replacement dayrates, without providing anything for the clients. You've heard me say this before, it's silly. And in order for us to have these dayrates keep action system rating, we have to provide additional services. What we are doing with the technology, we're taking technology that can part of it be developed from within, with internal expertise, and we're going to marry that with unique technologies that are external and that really add to our efficiencies on our rigs. We're going to apply our Drill-Smart tool. We're going to be our rigs coming out the Boudreaux and others will have -- will be classified as a smart rig, which is -- has a whole variety of sensing systems, predictive systems, systems that make our drillers and rig managers more efficient. And we think that's got for part and parcel of what the future holds. Showing up, charging something a dayrate, and thinking that's going to suffice is silly.

As you know, the backup give a little history, when we were acquiring different companies and we were attempting to set up benchmarks on how good we were, relative to our peer group, all the drillers had a tendency so to say we're the best guy in the world, but the reality is there's no benchmark that anybody used. We typically were dealing with personalities more than anything else. And Triton was a wonderful -- has been and will be a wonderful tool for us to measure what we did relative to our peer group because they used all of our peer groups' assets. So the first thing we did is set benchmarks and then we're really competing against ourselves in many -- in many regions. We can show our benchmark is -- and the results we achieve is far superior to any of the companies you alluded to. The other thing that -- it's not just operational. It's engineering. As you know, we have created a tremendous amount of value, as you know because you've been down to see the assets, of doing engineering and commissioning of our rigs and such a manner that we far exceeded any returns that our competitors will ever achieve. Some of the massive overruns by some of the companies you alluded to, they will never achieve a return on capital. The units at some point in my mind will have to be written down. So -- not to sound too boastful because we're not that way, but we don't look at the other drillers in and of themselves, anyone that you talked about, as competitors. They have drilling assets that will -- that we look at that -- from a design standpoint are interesting. But across the board, we really don't look at them as our major competitors. It's usually individual drilling assets. In terms of the technology giving us a more stable earnings base, I do appreciate your comment about we have done a reasonably good job. I think we've done a great job, on having steady earnings. I know there's a lot of discussion about long-term contracts, but I think the market today has fully appreciated was we were trying to do, and will do, selectively in the future. The technology can provide a different earnings base. For example, with the aluminum -- with the alloy riser, if we use that in a production mode, our clients will be the Shell's, the BP's, the objects of this world, and that will be a market that will be very unique. It will meet not too far afield from what we do, but a new, unique market. And what's wonderful about that, that is the latter part of the developmental mode. We go out and drill the wells. Then they start developing it. If he use tools of ours to do that, that just extends our exposure to the well bore. And so yes, this technology can provide some additional stability.\"],\n",

       "   \"Thank you, Jim. It's highlighted in our press release, first quarter earnings of 39 cents per share was slightly below last year's first quarter net income of 40 cents per share. Current results,$3.3 million for costs associated with the tax inversion and included in general and [INAUDIBLE] expense. The expense going forward approximate 6.5 million per quarter. Overall, our utilization dropped 1% to 86% in the first quarter this year. And reduced revenues by 1 million. This was offset by an increase in our dayrates to 62,700 per day, 2,000 more per day than last year, which added an addition at $2.8 million to our revenues. Operating costs in line with the fourth quarter, for Corporate effective tax rate, dropped to 17%, which reflects the mix and earnings being driven by international and the first quarter. Our tax rate should move closer to 20%. One last comment on the income statement. Included in other income expense, two gains. A 5.9 million dollar gain on the sale of our working interests in Falcon Prospect to Pioneer, and a 4 million dollar gain from the receipt of tax payments made in Canada related to the Bowden acquisition. We reclassify in the decline in our ocean rig stocks from temperature to permanent, which reduced the previously mentioned gains by 9.8 million you are. Our cash flow of $95 million funded 40 million of normal expenditures, with the remaining going to fund the previously disclosed acquisitions. We also utilized $59 million of our cash to fund the acquisitions. That's the total capitalization reduced to 24%, achieved by reducing debt 2% and increasing equity 4% during the quarter.

       "   \"Thank you, Mark. At our 2002 annual meeting of stockholders yesterday, all the items of business that were on our agenda were approved by stockholders. We elected two Directors to the Class of Directors for a three-year term, expiring in 2005. Approved amendments to two of our stock option plans. And also increased our authorized shares of capital stock from 200 million shares to 400 million shares, which will be available for issuance for proper Corporate purposes, without further shareholder action. With respect to our proposal to restructure our operations, we had an overwhelming endorsement of that proposal by our stockholders. Holders of 96.4% of the shares voting on the restructuring, voted in favor of the adoption. This will enable us to restructure so that our place of incorporation will be moved from Delaware to the Cayman Islands. The merger is scheduled to become effective after the close of business on April 30, 2002. And we will continue trading our stock under -- on the New York Stock Exchange, no changes in our trade simple, and stockholders will not have to do anything with respect to their certificates either. Just a couple of other comments on the restructuring to move our parent company, Noble Corporate Group, offshore. Our international operations accounted for 54% of our total operations in 2001 and 67% in the first quarter of this year. Net income attributable to our international operations during such periods was a higher percentage, and I think as everyone knows over 60% of our fleet of offshore assets are deployed into international markets. With our operations in the Gulf of Mexico, obviously, we will continue to pay U.S. taxes. But our new structure will promote our flexibility to reduce our worldwide effective Corporate tax rate. In addition, this new Corporate structure is generally more favor to expand our business through acquisitions in joint ventures. In the absence of the U.S. tax code that is more on a level playing field, the current tax system perhaps unwittingly could promote foreign takeovers of U.S. companies. As a leading provider of diversified service to the oil and gas industry, we're engaged in a global business with global competitive forces, and our Board of Directors yesterday our stockholders concur that they want us to remain competitive in the global marketplace. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Jim.\"],\n",

       "   \"Thank you, Bob. Before I start talking about activity, our activities around the world, I would add to what Bob said. We had very few comments from shareholders. I think there were a total of approximately 18 calls that we received. Once we explained why we were trying to make sure we remain competitive and that [INAUDIBLE] they all were in favor of the resolution to move overseas. I did receive two letters, is all, and again, most of them -- the two were under the impression that we were not going to pay any U.S. taxes, that the Officers were not going to pay any U.S. taxes, that somehow we would escape any exposure to U.S. taxes. And we tried to and did explain to them that we're going to continue to pay U.S. taxes on U.S. earned income, and that all we're trying to do is assure we remain competitive with our two largest competitors, Global Santa Fe and Transocean. With that, let me talk about -- there was a -- we were quoted yesterday in Reuters, and I think the lead part of the article was Noble says we're in for a rough year. For those of you that have read it, you needed -- the headline was really taken out of context. What I was saying that -- that clearly, with the possibility of an invasion of Iraq and given the political situation in Venezuela, that this could indeed be a challenging and rough year for the whole industry. We feel very comfortable with first call consensus, as we speak. But this is not a lay-down year. And I also made a comment in our news release that pronouncements by other in the drilling service sector that things are really starting to go up, I think -- I don't want anybody to jump off and believe that the turn has occurred. Fully -- anyone that's been involved with this industry over any length of time fully realizes that they're also going to be surprises. While yes, the Gulf of Mexico has started to improve, there are other areas that could be -- hold surprises. So don't -- don't jump on the hyperbole and think things have turned the corner. Without questioning what is going on [INAUDIBLE] Gulf of Mexico. We are saying improvement in in dayrates for jackups. Last recall from the last conference call, I indicated that what I did like at that point, it appeared dayrates were stopped falling. Right now, the first indication that dayrates are starting to improve. Now, they aren't -- they aren't running straight up, but we are seeing a thousand dollars here, three or four thousand dollars there. So that's a positive. Mexico continues to be rather slow in making commitments on rigs. They currently have plans for four additional rigs. They can either be MAP rigs or Independent Leg Cantilever rigs. They also have a need for one 300-foot jackup, in addition to the four, and after that we understand at some time in May, first of June, they'll have a requirement for a 350-foot independently cantilever jackup. So that process is still going. As we have indicated previously, that's a positive sign for the U.S. Gulf. Whenever it occurs we'll tighten the market in the U.S. Gulf, so we're very encouraged about that market. Hope to have additional units down before they're in. There's a possibility later in the year for in fact a semi, so you may also see a semi move out of the Gulf of Mexico. Venezuela, I don't need to spend a lot of time there. That was the quickest -- in reversal that in history of that sort of thing. As all of you are aware, we like that area. We like the geology in the lake. But I've also moved all of our rigs out quite some time ago because of the rather unusual political situation down there. I don't see any real help in Venezuela as far as taking rigs out of the Gulf of Mexico at this point in time. Brazil, Brazil continues to hold steady. Our operations continue there. We will in the second quarter pull one of our drill ships, The Leo, to do some upgrades to its drilling systems, so it will be down for a period. We don't see any need right now for additional semis. There has some discussion about jackups in Brazil, and we'll see if that develops later in the year. West Africa continues to be reasonably strong. We believe that there's -- will be an opportunity for a semi submersible and a jackup to go to that operating area. Hopefully, before year-end. So that's a positive sign. More than likely, they would be coming out of the Gulf Coast marine area, although it's possible that one jackup may come out of the North Sea. The North Sea is the weak sister, if you will. Internationally. Our competitors don't seem to learn that moving rigs on speck into a fully utilized market causes dayrate softening. I hope you write a book about that. And they tried to show the importance of demand and supply and that excess supply is going to kill demand, and dayrates, and -- but they don't seem to understand that. And there's some -- there's three idle rigs over there, and look for third, fourth quarter dayrates for jackups that are being rolled over to come down. If nothing else points to the importance of consolidation, it's the speculative move of rigs around the world. Middle East continues to be reasonably good. We obviously are concerned about the environment in the Middle East. I think most of you read some recent pronouncements by the leadership of Saudi Arabia about using oil as a political tool, a punitive tool. That is not good news. Obviously, the continued discussion about invasion of Iraq is not good news. But right now, things are reasonably subtle. Operations are going well. We've had no interruptions. East Coast of Canada, Hibernia, continues to operate, nothing to talk about there in terms of expansion at this point. The rigs in China, the idle rigs that we have recently bought, the Bingo 9,000 units and the Day Beard, Freeman Goldman semi-submersible, we're not doing anything on them at this point, but once the repurchase option expires, we will begin doing engineering and prepare for upgrading the two latter acquisitions. Let me talk about technology briefly. We have a lot of interest in our Alreiser. We're approximately 70% through our first complete production for our alloy reiser. And it's either en route or will be en route to Brazil in short order. And so that's going well, the manufacturing process. We will continue to manufacture additional strings and utilize them on other rigs in our fleet to take them into deeper water, more cost effectively than others using steel reiser. Once we get through with supplying, we will allow this technology to be licensed by others, and if so, we hope principally as production reiser which will will be a great market for. We have or will be making some announcements over the next 30 days on small acquisitions of technology. They're not big-dollar acquisitions, but we believe -- we're very optimistic they will have a nice impact on results in 2003 and 2004. Terms of our proprietary design Drill-Smart tool, I think we have 10 or -- nine or 10 units out. We will be staffing up hopefully over the next three to four quarters to increase the number of units we have out, not only on our fleet but on others around the world. Let me talk briefly about the two units that we recently bought from one of our competitors. They are now in the ship yard. We're assessing the amount of work that needs to be done on the units. What we will be doing as we previously announced is spending anywhere from 25 to $35 million, increasing the quarters. The quarters were not in Noble shape for our personnel, and we will completely renovate the quarters and actually increase the number of personnel that can live on them, from 80 to 110 to 120. We'll also work on the BOP handling system that the units had an antiquated system, and we'll bring them in line with our more technologically advanced systems on our EBA's. And we'll also stretch the units in terms of water depth, hopefully get them up to 4,000 feet, and perhaps up to 6,000 feet. We have interestingly enough completed previous engineering on similar designs to take them to 10,000 feet, so we know it can be done. It's obviously more money, but right now we're just targeting 4,000 feet. With that, I am confident that at this point, bargain some major surprising, that first call estimates are achievable by Noble. We're going to keep focused as we have in times past, and try to continue to lead this sector with returns on capitol and shareholder appreciation. I will now open the call to any questions you might have.\"],\n",

Now at once, everybody understood my strategy of having a balanced operation. If we could find opportunistic jackup purchases, we would do it. 300-foot jackups. We till like jackups. We just happen to believe near-term this our clients are more interested in very uniquely designed and engineered deepwater units. Now, I know others have said there is not a need for any more deepwater units. I would agree with that, in general. But I certainly wouldn't be -- if I had a large number of drillships, which are principally exploratory tools, I wouldn't feel good about the future of deepwater. There's way too much capacity brought in too quick, and that's the reason we didn't chase that market. I mean, there was a strategic reason for Noble not running at that, even though we had a great infrastructure. The future will be in the developmental type applications. With uniquely designed semis that have good motion characteristics, stay on location, and not cost an arm and a leg to operate, which the ships certainly are quite expensive. I know there's been some disappointments. In that intermediate depth of deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico, and there's been some disappointment in Brazil. But there's still a lot of interest in talking to the majors in deepwater and the Gulf of Mexico. And you know them. And -- so we're still encouraged about it. We're not talking about slugging the market with a half dozen rigs. What we're doing, as you're aware, with the Boudreaux is doing a preliminary steelwork for that unit to work in the Golden Triangle. We didn't talk about West Africa, but West Africa -- I mean, you can argue there's been some near-term disappointment there, but not substantial amount of disappointment, and there's still very excited about the geology in West Africa. So would I be [INAUDIBLE] I had a bunch of drillships just built, worrying about deepwater markets? You bet.

I'm not talking about -- I want to put a bracket around that -- dramatic could be four or 500 million dollar acquisition, something that of. Could question we're do that? Yes. Have we looked at it? Yes. The numbers haven't worked yet. But they might. So yes, we could step up. I'm not talking about dramatic in terms of two or 3 billion dollars. At least at this point. But there are some small intermediate type companies like that that make sense. Now, the acquisitions I alluded to accumulatively would be less than 20 million dollars we're currently talking about. So I'll give you an order of magnitude. And where are we going? I believe that dayrates, particularly deepwater, highly technical drilling, will go back up. And I know everyone on the phone hopes that they will go back up. But I think that as they start reaching back to -- reaching their old levels or surpassing them, that our clients -- and if you remember, I have representatives from Shell, BP, and independent called Kerm, GE, on my Board. And what I can say is people will demand more than just a trialer showing up on location with his drilling rig and saying, what do you want me to do? They're going to demand more, greater abilities in terms of technology. They're going to be more demanding on operating efficiencies. They're going to be more demanding of our people in terms of providing guidance and assistance. This whole period that we went through when everybody was saying, boy, look at the drillers, they're automatically going to this theoretical replacement dayrates, without providing anything for the clients. You've heard me say this before, it's silly. And in order for us to have these dayrates keep action system rating, we have to provide additional services. What we are doing with the technology, we're taking technology that can part of it be developed from within, with internal expertise, and we're going to marry that with unique technologies that are external and that really add to our efficiencies on our rigs. We're going to apply our Drill-Smart tool. We're going to be our rigs coming out the Boudreaux and others will have -- will be classified as a smart rig, which is -- has a whole variety of sensing systems, predictive systems, systems that make our drillers and rig managers more efficient. And we think that's got for part and parcel of what the future holds. Showing up, charging something a dayrate, and thinking that's going to suffice is silly.

As you know, the backup give a little history, when we were acquiring different companies and we were attempting to set up benchmarks on how good we were, relative to our peer group, all the drillers had a tendency so to say we're the best guy in the world, but the reality is there's no benchmark that anybody used. We typically were dealing with personalities more than anything else. And Triton was a wonderful -- has been and will be a wonderful tool for us to measure what we did relative to our peer group because they used all of our peer groups' assets. So the first thing we did is set benchmarks and then we're really competing against ourselves in many -- in many regions. We can show our benchmark is -- and the results we achieve is far superior to any of the companies you alluded to. The other thing that -- it's not just operational. It's engineering. As you know, we have created a tremendous amount of value, as you know because you've been down to see the assets, of doing engineering and commissioning of our rigs and such a manner that we far exceeded any returns that our competitors will ever achieve. Some of the massive overruns by some of the companies you alluded to, they will never achieve a return on capital. The units at some point in my mind will have to be written down. So -- not to sound too boastful because we're not that way, but we don't look at the other drillers in and of themselves, anyone that you talked about, as competitors. They have drilling assets that will -- that we look at that -- from a design standpoint are interesting. But across the board, we really don't look at them as our major competitors. It's usually individual drilling assets. In terms of the technology giving us a more stable earnings base, I do appreciate your comment about we have done a reasonably good job. I think we've done a great job, on having steady earnings. I know there's a lot of discussion about long-term contracts, but I think the market today has fully appreciated was we were trying to do, and will do, selectively in the future. The technology can provide a different earnings base. For example, with the aluminum -- with the alloy riser, if we use that in a production mode, our clients will be the Shell's, the BP's, the objects of this world, and that will be a market that will be very unique. It will meet not too far afield from what we do, but a new, unique market. And what's wonderful about that, that is the latter part of the developmental mode. We go out and drill the wells. Then they start developing it. If he use tools of ours to do that, that just extends our exposure to the well bore. And so yes, this technology can provide some additional stability.\"],\n",

The quarter itself was just a brutal quarter where everyone was down significantly. It's not a very large exposure to our balance sheet but we have some investments in it.

We closed that transaction this quarter. We also on the last day of the quarter did a transaction for a company called Golf Smith which is, you know, it was $75 million proceeds, $99 million face amount transaction, under the radar screen, during the last week.

Electronic business is obviously just a lower number on a per revenue basis. It's still extremely good business and highly profitable on a net basis. But the revenue line item sort of reflects that.

This presentation contains forward-looking statements that may describe future plans and strategic initiatives. These forward-looking statements are based on current plans, and expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties which could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance, future expectations. Further information on these risks factors and uncertainties can be found in Chittenden’s annual report on Form 10-K. Chittenden undertakes no obligation, publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or there is a result of new information future events or changes.\n",
      " Now I'd like to go with the formats for this conference call. First, I will review the financial results for the second quarter. And after my remarks there will be time for questions. I gather all of you know the drill for asking questions. As is normal I'd like to start with the balance sheet for June 30, 2005 and talk through some of the fluctuations both remainder last year as well as the prior quarters. As you can see the Company’s securities portfolio is down on both a link quarter basis as well as from the prior year-end. The decrease in the portfolio from the first quarter is primarily due to maturities that were utilized upon loan growth. Which was partially offset by an increase of 13.6 million in the fair value of the securities due to lower market interest rates. Securities portfolio is equally split between agencies, Corporate's and mortgage backed securities. And the duration at June 30, 2005 was 2.3 years. In relation to the loan portfolio the Company's total loans increased 4.3% from the prior year-end and 3.1% in the first quarter of ‘05. The increase from the prior periods relates to continued strong growth in the Company's commercial portfolio as well as it's residential loans. Which is partially offset by declines in municipal and construction loans.\n",
      " Looking at the specific loans portfolio its CNI portfolio experienced annualized growth of 9.6% on a link quarter basis and 7.5% from the prior year-end. The growth in the CNI portfolio came primarily from the company's Vermont in Central Massachusetts market. It was equally split between higher volume utilization from existing customers and new relationships. Company's municipal portfolio experienced it's normal seasonal trend and is down from the first quarter of ‘05 as well as the prior year-end. The municipal loans are very short in duration and the portfolio tends to peak during the fourth quarter and reach at low point in the second quarter of each year. The company's multi-family and commercial real estate portfolios continue to experience solid growth. The second quarter of ‘05 the commercial real estate portfolio grew 5% from March 31, 2005 and 9% from the prior year-end. The growth in the commercial real estate portfolio from that the prior year-end as well as the first quarter is partially offset by a reduction in the construction portfolio as commercial customers completed their projects and rolled them into permanent financing.\n",
      " The growth in the commercial real estate portfolio is not specifically concentrated in the England market or industry. It's important to note that over two thirds of the commercial real estate portfolio is owner occupied and the similar ratio is variable rate loans. As I previously mentioned, the construction loan portfolio was down from about the prior year-end as well as the first quarter of '05 and flat compared to the similar quarter of a year ago. The emphasis on the construction portfolio relates to the financing of projects for commercial customers as well as individual consumer loans. Accordingly this portfolio is comprised of approximately 33% in individual consumer construction loans, 26% in loans to commercial customers or on our occupied properties, 24% to residential developers, 17% to commercial customers for investor properties.\n",
      " Residential one to four family portfolio was up on a linked quarter basis as well as from the prior year-end. Strong growth of over 12% annualized from the first quarter of '05 was primarily attributable the higher originations of adjustable rate mortgage loans. As well as increased production private banking loans.\n",
      " The Company continued to experience solid growth in its home equity credit line portfolio from the end of the prior year as well as on a linked quarter basis, the annualized growth in the [E-Lock] portfolio of 13.7% from the first quarter of '05 was primarily concentrated in the Vermont and Maine markets. The [E-Lock] line commitment increased by 22.8 million from March 31, and the utilization rate was 48%. The Company's consumer loan portfolio experienced over 5% growth from the first quarter of '05 and was up from the prior year-end as well as the similar period of a year ago, the increase was due to higher originations of indirect loans as well a slow down in prepayment from this portfolio. The growth in the consumer loan portfolio was primarily concentrated in the Vermont market and the mix of originations of 60-40 between new and used vehicles.\n",
      " The Company's deposits were up on a link quarter basis as well as from the prior year-end. The Company experienced its normal seasonal decline in deposits from municipal customers of approximately a 100 million in the second quarter and 150 million since the beginning of the year. which was offset by increases in CD's and demand deposits. the increase in demand deposits was from our commercial customers and reflects to normal seasonality in their business cycles. In relation to the growth in CD's the Company believes this is being generated by our customer's desire for higher interest rates as well as willingness to invest the money for longer time periods. Average term in the company's CD's less than a 100,000 is 12 months greater than a 100,000 is 9 months. on an overall basis the Company is pleased with the deposit growth of 4.7% from the similar period of a year ago and we will continue to carefully monitor the mix of its deposits to minimize the impact on its funding cost.\n",
      " The Company is finding [inaudible] in relatively light in CD is approximately 46% of our deposit base as comprised with demand savings in now accounts which have an overall weighted average cost of 26 basis points the second quarter of 2005. In addition nearly 28% of our deposits are held in [CMA] money market accounts with an average weighted cost of a 123 basis points. The level of our demand deposits in now accounts which represent 36% of total deposit at June 30th 2005 reports our view that customer use us as the primary financial institution. It’s important to realize that the company's superior funding base is not been accomplished by paying up on the deposits. Overall costs of our deposits in the second quarter of ’05 was 112 basis points and our all-in cost of funds was 129 basis points, which is significantly below industry averages.\n",
      " The company has reposing other borrowings for flat on both the linked-quarter basis and from the prior year-end, and were up from the similar quarter over a year ago. Increased from June 30 of ’04 was primarily due to higher levels of short-term borrowings, which were utilized to fund loan growth. Stockholder’s equity was up on the linked-quarter basis as well as from the prior year-end in the similar quarter over year ago. Increased to March 31 of ’05 with 22.3 million was primarily related to 12.4 million increase in retained earning and an 8.8 million after tax increase in the fair market value of the company’s securities portfolio. Increase in the fair market value of the company’s securities portfolio is primarily attributable to our long-term interest rates at June 30 of ’05. The company’s securities portfolio is primarily managed for cash flow and yield, and accordingly the change in the fair market value has minimal impact on the company’s liquidity or operations. And the book value increased from $8.23 per share at March 31, 2005, $8.71 per share at June 30 of ’05.\n",
      " The tangible capital ratio was 6.78% at June 30 of ’05, which was up both on a linked-quarter basis as well as from the prior year-end and the similar period of over year ago. The company remains well capitalized and continues to be a strong internal generator of capital. Company also announced a quarterly dividend of 18 cents per share; dividends were repaid on August 12, 2005 to serve as a record on July 29, 2005. In summary as we look at our balance sheet on June 30 of '05, you can see it's a typical Chittenden balance sheet whereby the loan portfolio is over 70% commercial loans. The funding base is over 90% core deposits and customer repose.\n",
      " Certainly one of Chittenden’s strengths over the last few years has been the excellent credit quality that companies enjoyed through a variety of economic cycles. On June 30, 2005, the company reported non-performing assets, including loans or a 90 based past due and still accruing of 25.1 million which was flat on a linked-quarter basis and out from the prior year-end as well as the similar quarter of a year ago. The company’s no-performing asset ratio is 54 basis points to June 30 of '05, or it is up slightly from the first quarter and slight with the second quarter of the year ago.\n",
      " Company’s net charge offs were one basis point in the second quarter was flat on a linked-quarter basis and down from 2 basis points in the comparable quarter in 2004. As we have discussed in our prior commentary due the significant commercial presence in the company’s loan portfolio. The charge off and recoveries on a quarterly basis can be relatively volatile and tend to reflect specific events relating to each commercial customer versus the normal systematic process that charge offs and consumer lending. In addition it's important to know that loan to the payments less than 30 days past due represent 53% of the total loans and non-accrual\n",
      " And the company amounts for loan losses as a percentage of total loans is 1.43% at the end of the second quarter, which is down from their 1.45% of March 31 ‘05, as well as the prior year-end. From a macro standpoint, we remain very vigilant on the credit front. We continue to monitor, criticize and classify loans as well as economy activity within our respective market, not only from reported economy data, but also from the ancillary data that comes in from our loan officers and customer base. Our over all standpoint will continue to see all of the company's credit quality and reserves remain very strong.\n",
      " Company's fully diluted earnings per share was up 7.3% from the first quarter of ‘05 and 12.8% from the comparable quarter in ‘04. Second quarter of ‘05, the company earned 20.8 million or 44 cents per share, compared to 18.2 million or 39 cents per share similar period of a year ago. Primary reasons for the increase in earnings per share and net income from the first quarter of ‘05 were higher net interest income and lower non-interest expenses which were partially off set by a higher provision for loan losses. The company's net interest income is up 9.5% from the comparable period of year ago, and increased approximately 1.9% from the first quarter of ‘205. The net interest margin for the second quarter of 2005 was 4.29% which was affectively flat on a linked quarter basis. Up to 11 basis points from the similar quarter of the prior year. Increase in the net interest margin from the comparable quarter of 2004 primarily related to a higher yield on loans, was driven increases in the prime rate, as well a s continue improvement in the company asset mix.\n",
      " The second quarter of 2005, loans comprised 75% of earning assets and increased 2.6% from the similar quarter in '04. Our securities comprised 25% of earning assets, which comes to a decrease of 2% in the similar quarter a year ago. One basis point decrease in the net interest margin on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to a higher proportion of CDs in the deposit base which increased the company's cost of funds, and off set the higher yield on the company's loans portfolio. In addition, approximately one basis point of the three basis point increase in the Company's net interest margin in the first quarter of 2005, from the fourth quarter of 2004 was attributable to the market decline in the company's securities portfolio which was substantially recovered the second quarter.\n",
      " Relation in the company's interest sensitivity, we remain slightly asset sensitive with a majority of our commercial loans from equity credit lines tied to the prime index. However, as the Company experienced in the second quarter of 2005; the mix of the Company's deposit base coupled with the timing of increases in the prime rate as well as the changes in the market value of the securities portfolio, ineffectively neutralized the Company's slight assets sensitivity. Company's provision for loan losses is up 325,000 on a linked-quarter basis, and 300,000 from the comparable quarter of '04. Primary reason for the increased provision from the afore mentioned periods was continued, strong commercial loan growth.\n",
      " Total non-interest income was down on both a linked quarter basis as well as from the second quarter of 2004. The primary reason for the decline on linked quarter basis is lower insurance commissions which is partially off set by higher other income. Lower insurance commissions reflect the normal seasonality in this particular business operation which is generated from the timing and the policy renewal cycles, as well as the payment of the performance-base commissions. The increase in other income from the first quarter ‘05 related to higher debit card and ATM fees, and gains of 207,000 on asset sales.\n",
      " The decrease from the comparable quarter of 2004, a 3.5 million related to lower mortgaged banking income, as well as lower investment management and trust fees and service charges on deposits. The decrease in mortgaged servicing income is primarily attributable to lower impairment recoveries. 1.8 million on the company's MSRs, which was partially off set by lower amortization of 644,000. The decrease in gains and sales of loans of 900,000, related to a decline in sales by approximately 58 million. The decline from the similar quarter of a year ago in the investment management trust fees primarily related to lower annuity sales of the company's broker-dealer operation. The company also experience a decline in service charges and deposits to reflect the banks continued success in expanding their relationship accounts, lower over draft fee income from our customers.\n",
      " Non-interest expense is 43.4 million for the second quarter ‘05, a decrease 2 million on linked quarter basis 2.6 million from the same period a year ago. Primary reasons for the decrease on a linked quarter basis due to lower employee benefits and occupancy cost which are partially offset by higher other expenses. Decline in employ benefits expense, primarily related to 1.5 million curtailment gain. The company recognized in the second quarter of 2005 and decided to freeze its declining benefit pension plan and redirect the delivery of its pension benefits through the 401k plan.\n",
      " The Company’s decision to change the delivering mechanism for its employee’s pension benefit was primarily driven by desire to simplify and increase affordability in employees’ retirement benefit as well as to reduce administrative costs. The Company structured this change, so that all rest of it's employees are provided a transition benefit, so that future retirement contributions made on their behalf to the 401k plan is equal to the benefit they would have received under the defined benefit pension plan. The decision revolving in the recognition of 1.5 million and remaining deferred credits relating to pension plan changes made in the mid1990. Remaining decrease in the Company’s employee benefits expense from the first quarter of '05 related to lower payroll taxes and medical expenses.\n",
      " In relation to the reduction and net occupancy expense, the company experiences normal seasonal decrease in property expenses and utility bills. Increase in other expenses from the first quarter of '05 primarily related to higher legal costs and increased [E-lock] loan closings. A decline in non-interest expenses from the second quarter 2004, primarily related to lower employee benefits, data processing and conversion restructuring charges which are partially offset by higher occupancy costs and other expenses. Primary reasons for the decline in employee benefit expense related to the aforementioned curtailment again from the Company’s changes is defined benefit pension plan. Reduction in data processing expense and conversion and restructuring charges related to the conversion of the Company’s IT platform as well as the merger of Granite Bank and National Bank in the second quarter of 2004.\n",
      " Increase in other expenses from the similar period of year ago was due to higher legal fees, examination fees and education and training expenses. The Company’s efficiency ratio excluding the curtailment gain for the second quarter of 2005 was 57.14% which was down on both on linked-quarter basis and from the comparable quarters of 2004. The effective income tax rate for the second quarter of '05 was 35.9% compared to 36.4% in the first quarter of '05 and 36.3% for the similar period in '04. Lower effective income tax rate on a linked-quarter basis is primarily attributable to higher tax credits from qualified low income housing CRA projects.\n",
      " The Company’s return on average tangible equity increased to 21.37%, in the second quarter of '05 as compared to 21.01% in the similar quarter of a year ago. The return on average equity for the second quarter was 13.27%, up from the 12.4% in the comparable quarter of year ago. Increase in ROE resulted from higher levels of net income which is partially off set by higher average levels of stockholders equity. Return on average assets for the second quarter of '05 was 1.36% compared to 1.26 % a similar quarter of '04.\n",
      " The company continues to be encouraged by the improved operating performance both on the linked-quarter basis as well as from the similar quarter a year ago. And believe that is well positioned to benefit from the completion of our technology and organizational initiatives in 2004. At this point I've gone down long enough and will be happy to answer any question.\n",

      "  Sure, in terms of non performing assets, increase were about 20 million to -- which has been sort of a run rate, to about 23 million; the increase was primarily due to one, relationship down in Western Massachusetts that went on non-accrual and was partially a C&amp;I line as well as some real asset [clatter] that we had with it. The loan is current and remains current on their payments and that was a primary inflow that we saw. In terms of across the markets, I would say it's been fairly normal activity in terms of loan levels coming in to non-performers, you know curing and moving out.\n",

      "  Well the -- in terms of the securities portfolio, as you know over the last number of quarters, we have continued to bring our securities portfolio down as we have had strong loan growth and have continued to utilize some of the liquidity from our securities portfolio from that loan growth. In terms of the cash flow, of the securities -- or of the liquidity portfolio we would expect, number right here, the expected cash flow for the remainder of '05 of that portfolio is about 155 million and for '06 is about 240 million and those numbers will both be reported in the 10-Q which will be brought tomorrow.\n",

We tend to keep our duration around 2.5 years and we tear it out because our expectation has grown, our good cash flow is coming in the help support long growth, if it's stronger than our deposit growth.

In terms of the competitive environment, I would view it, you know that, it remains very competitive environment clearly the bigger players in our market, being Banc of America, Citizens, Bank North and Sovereign are all continue to be very active on both these loans and deposit front as well as be in all of our markets, these smaller community banks and the mutual savings banks and credit union. So, I would say that it remains very competitive and in particular, I think on the deposit front, I think that the deposit pricing has probably stepped up in March in terms of the competitiveness there.\n",

Just a couple of things just to follow-up on the employee benefits line and specifically so I'm just trying to calculate the run rate savings that I don’t know exactly when [inaudible] in the quarter, but if I look at the March quarter, take the June quarter add back the 1.5 and the 5.783.

So we have continue to move up to deposit cost now as the overall loan side and the increase in Fed funds drive in prime rates of an increased as well. In terms of the market place itself yes I think it is very competitive out there for deposits we do have. In the second quarter we did have a little heavier mix of CD's and we've had in the last few quarters and also the second quarter does reflect the seasonality in our municipal deposits largely impact our CMA in money market accounts.

It’s probably utilized for variety of means from buy backs to special dividends in today’s world. Also, whether to retain capital pay out fee, trust referred when it’s callable.

So we have held that if you were to look at our deposits, service charges on deposits it’s probably our expectation is that, that number remains flat over time, and may even decrease some, depending on our success at moving customers into the relationship accounts and growing their balance in the relationship accounts.\n",

The second -- can you show us what's your thoughts on what's you front line lenders are telling you in terms of what they are confronting from a underwriting standard competitive position.

Our case, our underwriting standards have not changed from we have a long history, we have had in terms of underwriting the loans and of course I think our credit results reflect that. So I -- from the market stand point what we hear in from lenders to begin that we don't here an awful lot in terms of changes in competitively and looking the deals with others from the pure underwriting side and that may be more of a function of just the markets and the people who are competing against in our particular market.\n",

      "  Another question going back to the liability side of the balance sheet with your deposits. In your filings that you made with the average balance sheet, you give us of course the rates being paid on deposits as well as the average balances on a year-over-year basis, and it’s interesting to note that your savings in our account pay incredibly low rate of interest considering how much rate have risen in last 12 months, but it looks like this rate of interest has led to decline in those balances as evidenced by the year-over-year drops in both those categories. It’s also true it looks like for your seeing a money market accounts and of course you pointed out that you have the growth in CD's. Is there any likelihood that, that strategy may change, whether you would raise more aggressively in those particular accounts, so that they can start to show us some growth. Or are you content and set with the way it’s set -- the way it is right now where you'll just go through CD's?\n",

      "  You know I think historically the mix of our deposits are very important to us and our real focus is on the accounts other than CDs. We do as we continue to build our municipal business in various banks. I think you do see more of an impact from the municipal outflows and seasonality which tends to affect the first three account savings now as money markets, than what we may have in prior years and as I mentioned earlier, I think we have also seen in terms of the growth in the CD book has been largely internal as customers have really looked for some more yield and also been willing to put their money out for a little longer time frame. So, our focus will continue to be on the, really the demands, our savings now, and money market accounts as we go forward with a intent of growing those and, what I think on a long-term basis and expectation that the CD book or any growth in that would probably slow down. The CD book had, when rates got so low, the CD book had got into a level that was probably abnormally low. So, seeing it come back up is, to the level tell tells okay but certainly, on long-term basis the focus will be in our transaction accounts.\n",

Do you -- what do you guys point to is the reason for these levels coming down? Is it purely a function of rates that because the rates are relatively low that people have decided to pull the money out and is it as simple, if you are going to focus on these accounts going forward? Is it as simple as just raising those rates to more competitive levels to get the money and then pull back into them?\n",

      "  I would say that it’s not specifically rate driven, I mean I think it's a variety of things that go on in terms of impacting some of these accounts including our commercial customers, needs and including the small business entrepreneurs type, needs for cash as they continue to grow their businesses and utilizing the cash that those get, generated to even personal cash to continue to fund the growth versus actually taking down loans. So I think it's a combination of factors that goes in to what impacts the flows in these accounts and just needs to be a continual focus on our part to continue to build their accounts and bring in the operating accounts from all of our commercial customers and, you know, the main accounts of individual customers that may be customer of our wealth management operation in those groups. So I don’t think it's specifically rate driven. We do very much try to be in the pack on our rates and depending upon the package accounts at year-end and the level of funds out with us, we become very competitive on the rates. So --\n",

      "  Finally going to credit, your position bumped up a little bit this quarter and certainly you had a bump-up in your position in the fourth quarter. But that look liked it was to cover the bump-up in that charge-offs you had in the fourth quarter where as your charge-offs is for -- were pretty stable with the quarters of last year and the first quarter of this year. Should we expect a slightly higher provision level of maybe 14 to 15 basis points to average loans going forward versus, you know, a 10 to 11 basis point level that we have been seeing in the last three to nine months?\n",

      "  Well the provisioning, of course is looked at on a quarter-by-quarter basis and this quarter the increase in the provisioning was largely driven by these stronger loan growths that we had this quarter and so that is something that we would, continue to evaluate as we go forward and in fact, and it's also very much coupled into where the level of charge-offs are.\n",

      "  Well as we -- as I indicated in my commentary, certainly our modeling would continue to indicate we are a slightly of that sensitive and of course we had a prime increase starting in early July. So, and we will see the municipal flows, that type of business start coming back in. So I think our guidance would be similar to what we have given in the past quarters that we would in all things being equally expect to see our margin probably move out of a couple of ticks a quarter in this type of environment, but certainly we can see in the second quarter that it did impacted by the mix in the deposits. So as the inflows come in hopefully we will be going back to more of a normalized, uptake in the margin.\n",
