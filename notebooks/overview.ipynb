We continue to execute on our strategy, and this is generating results. When looking at the quarter, we increased the business momentum, continued margin improvement and profit growth. The organic sales growth increased to 6% with strong growth in Europe and Ibero-America. We had negative growth as expected in North America, but are now turning the corner and expecting to return to positive growth in the third quarter. The operating margin increased to 5.8%, and we're now almost 1% higher margin when comparing with the pre-COVID years.\\r\\n North America and Ibero-America are the main contributors and the margin in Europe was stable when comparing to the same period last year. But the external environment continues to be challenging in terms of labor scarcity and inflation, but we are managing well and have a positive price/wage balance year-to-date. And given the circumstances, we will continue to work with dynamic price increases to balance wage increases and importantly, to safeguard the quality of our delivery to our clients.\\r\\n And as is visible in the numbers, a strong focus on improving profitability is now starting to generate real results. We had 13% real sales growth in solutions and Electronic Security, which is a very strong performance with good growth across all segments. And our offering is strong, and we are winning more business at improved margins versus last year. And this, in combination with portfolio management and the impacts from the transformation programs is resulting in higher profitability.\\r\\n And last but not least, we are very proud that Securitas, as the first major security services company, has committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative. Sustainability has always been a focus here at Securitas, but this is further proof of our commitment to continue to deliver sustainable security and safety services and leading the industry also in this important aspect.\\r\\n And as you have hopefully noticed, we were also very glad to announce last week that we have now closed the Stanley Security. And the joint integration preparation work has been solid, and we are very happy and ready to join forces now with the Stanley Security team. And we have planned for an investor update on August 24 to share more about the strategy of the group with new financial targets, and I hope that you are able to join us virtually for that session.\\r\\n So with that, let us now turn in the different business segments. And starting with North America, where, as expected, we did have negative organic growth in the quarter due to the termination of announced low-margin contracts, but also a very significant reduction in COVID-related extra sales compared with the same period last year. But we have good underlying momentum in the North American business. New sales are strong in the Guarding business, and we're managing price increases successfully and in a dynamic manner.\\r\\n The Electronic Security installation business improved in Q2 after a challenging start to the year, but we're still facing challenges related to component shortage and labor shortage. But it is important to note that we had positive organic sales growth, strong order intake and record level backlog in the quarter.\\r\\n And our Pinkerton risk management business is also growing at a healthy pace and contributing. So based on this underlying strength, we are expecting to return to positive organic sales growth in the third quarter.\\r\\n And looking then at the profitability, the margin expansion in North America continues with improvements supported by all business units. The operating margin of 7.4% is the highest ever achieved in North America. And there are a number of reasons behind this. And starting with the Guarding business, there are a few key drivers behind the positive development. The business transformation program that we finished last year, active portfolio management and an increase in solution sales are all contributing to the positive development.\\r\\n Looking at Electronic Security, we had an improved business mix and also solid execution by our team, and that also contributed to the results. The development of our Pinkerton business was also solid, and we also had a positive contribution from the Critical Infrastructure Services business.\\r\\n So when you're looking at North America, we have undertaken significant modernization and digitization on North America business with significant investments over the last couple of years. And our team's execution of the strategy is now generating results with structurally higher margins.\\r\\n So with that, let us then shift the focus to Europe, where we had very strong growth of 9% in the quarter. And there are a few factors contributing to the growth. First, we had positive portfolio development. So that means the strong commercial momentum is resulting in positive portfolio growth also when excluding price increases. Secondly, the aviation business is returning to more normalized levels of demand. This also contributed. And third, we are increasing prices at significantly higher rates than normal to balance wage increases.\\r\\n But I'm also very glad to report that we had solid growth in sales of Solutions and Electronic Security in Europe in the quarter, and that also had a real positive impact on the sales growth.\\r\\n And looking at the profitability, the margin of 5.5% was stable versus the same quarter last year despite the challenges related to sickness and labor shortages. At active portfolio management as well as previously acquired Electronic Security businesses contributed positively to the margin.\\r\\n Sickness rates and the cost related to labor shortages improved somewhat versus the first quarter but are still impacting the bottom line in a negative way. And as was the case in the first quarter, these challenges are more pronounced in a few markets in Europe and in the rest of the countries, we are managing quite well.\\r\\n Cost measures and some leverage from the strong growth also helped the margin. So when looking ahead, we expect the labor market in Europe to remain challenging, and we continue to work in a more dynamic manner to balance wage increases with price increases. And apart from that, we're also actively promoting connected technology and integrated solutions to our clients as a means to improve the security equation and managing total cost for our clients.\\r\\n And moving then to Ibero-America, where we have continued very positive development in terms of top line growth but also profitability. And in Spain, we had organic sales growth of 10% in the quarter with a strong development across the business. Latin America improved compared to last year, but price increases in Argentina were the primary driver from a Latin American perspective, contribution to the growth. And the good momentum with sales of Security Solutions and Electronic Security continued. These sales are now representing 30% of total sales.\\r\\n But we also have very strong development in terms of profitability. Our Ibero-America team are executing on the strategy, create a sharper and more profitable business, and this is paying off. The operating margin is 40 to 50 basis points higher versus the same period last year and more than 1% higher when comparing with the pre-COVID periods. And the improvement is driven by Spain, Portugal, but we also had positive contribution from most countries in Latin America that are performing at a higher level.\\r\\n So all in all, a strong quarter, strong continued development of the overall business. And I think with that, I hand over to Andreas for some more details regarding the financials.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [2]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Magnus, and good afternoon, everyone. We start, as always, with our income statement here. The second quarter was as Magnus mentioned, a strong quarter with solid growth and an improving operating margin at 5.8%.\\r\\n The operating margin is not only strong when comparing to last year, but also substantially higher than the pre-COVID Q2 levels at around 5%, confirming that our execution of the strategy is on the right way. The margin development was supported by strong double-digit growth in the high-margin solutions and Electronic Security business. And the teams have done a really good job with the price/wage balance, which so far in the year are contributing to the margin.\\r\\n I should highlight that the operating result in the second quarter did not include any material government grants related to COVID-19 and the number of people on temporary unemployment was on very low levels. One accounting update, here in the second quarter, is that Turkey, as from April 1, is considered hyperinflationary for the purpose of the reporting under IAS 29 hyperinflation. As you know, we have also applied IAS 29 for our operations in Argentina since Q3 2018. It is a straightforward standard from the perspective that it targets to give better insight into the effect from high inflation, both related to the balance sheet and the income statement. The implementation of this standard is, however, fairly technical in nature. And to keep it simple here related to Turkey, the impact on Securitas is not material, as you can also see on Page 9 in the report under the table for security services Europe. The impact on the balance sheet related to Turkey is an increase in capital employed of SEK 463 million and the same amount increased in equity. That relates to the revaluation that we then do on the opening balance sheet on April 1. Then during the quarter, we have reevaluated the income statement and the balance sheet as well. The conclusion of that is that there is almost no effect on sales nor operating results. The most significant impact is within the financial items line with a positive effect of SEK 17 million. We have continued to treat the effects from the standard similar to currency impact. This means that none of our key ratios, such as organic growth or real change are impacted from bringing Turkey in. You'll find more details around this in Note 8 of the report.\\r\\n If we then have a look below the operating result. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was SEK 61 million in the quarter, basically the same number as in the first quarter and nothing major to report here.\\r\\n Looking at the acquisition-related costs, they were again limited in the quarter as our acquisition activity is reduced after the announcement of the Stanley transaction. We have posted acquisitions to focus on the Stanley integration and deleveraging of our balance sheet position. There may be 1 or 2 smaller exceptions to this, but there will be nothing major in the coming quarters. So we expect the acquisition-related costs to be lower than 2021 for the full year. Remember here that the acquisition costs related to Stanley is reported under items affecting comparability.\\r\\n Going then to exactly that, items affecting comparability. Here, we had SEK 226 million of cost in the quarter, which is approximately SEK 30 million less than last year. The reduction is a consequence of us closing down 3 programs at the end of 2021. Of the SEK 226 million, SEK 169 million was related to the ongoing European and Ibero-America transformation programs and the residual SEK 57 million was paid transaction costs related to the Stanley acquisition. And I will come back with some more information here on the next page.\\r\\n If we then have a look at the financial net. Here, we had a SEK 30 million reduction in cost in the quarter. The underlying interest cost increased somewhat due to the increased interest rates that we are seeing, but we had some smaller positive FX impacts and together with around SEK 30 million positive impact from IAS-29. That explains the difference here.\\r\\n As I mentioned earlier, SEK 17 million is related to Turkey and the residual is related to Argentina, referencing then the SEK 30 million IAS-29 impact. Given the high inflation and increased interest rate in the market, we are expecting to see an increased financial net for the full year 2022, when we compare to 2021, also then excluding the impacts of the hyperinflation. This is, of course, also excluding the finance costs related to Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n Looking at the tax. The tax rate forecast for the full year remains at 27.0%, and there are basically no major news in this forecast.\\r\\n On the next slide, we have some additional information related then to the programs we are running under items affecting comparability. Important here is that we closed down 3 programs at the end of last year, which is reducing the complexity here. In North America, the team is continuing to execute on realizing the benefits from the North America transformation program that we implemented last year. We see positive margin impacts from the program in 2022, and there is further potential here going forward. The European and Ibero-America transformation programs are continuing the execution. The programs are on track, and we will, over the coming quarters, start to go live in phases with new digital platforms in several countries. We have an important year ahead of us in terms of execution here.\\r\\n The items affecting comparability related to these programs were SEK 169 million in the second quarter, and our estimate for the full year is between SEK 550 million and SEK 600 million. And this then also includes the impact from the cloud computing accounting regulations implemented and communicated in Q4.\\r\\n We have, as I mentioned, also occurred SEK 57 million of costs related to the Stanley acquisition in the quarter. Totally, since the announcement, we have spent SEK 132 million of the approximately SEK 1.4 billion transaction integration and restructuring costs related to the acquisition. The plan is that the majority of these costs will be expensed over 2022 and 2023.\\r\\n Moving then to the next page, where we have an overview of the FX impact on the income statement. There were major impacts from FX in the quarter, mainly related to the U.S. dollar that appreciated 19% to the Swedish krona compared to last year. The total FX impact on sales was 9% in the second quarter, mainly then driven by the U.S. dollar, while the euro appreciated 5%.\\r\\n Looking at our operating result, the FX impact was a bit higher at 12%, mainly due to the higher profitability levels in our North American business and the currency impact increased further when looking at EPS. The EPS real change before items affecting comparability was solid at 10% in the quarter and 11% for the first 6 months with good cost leverage on the items below operating result. Including the items affecting comparability, the real change was even a bit stronger coming from the reduced IC spend this year.\\r\\n We then move to cash flow. The cash flow from operating activities was SEK 927 million or 53% of the operating result in the second quarter, a good improvement compared to the first quarter and a solid Q2 outcome, taking into consideration the current high growth that we are seeing in the business. If we look into the larger movements here in the quarter, we saw an increase in CapEx of almost SEK 190 million. We saw an increase in our investments into our solution contracts, which confirms the positive momentum we have in the high-margin solutions business. A major part of the increase was also related to the existing transformation programs, which are progressing according to plan.\\r\\n The CapEx to sales was 2.8% in the quarter, and we continue to expect to come in below 3% for the year. The account receivables was minus SEK 873 million. And here, we see the impact from the strong growth that we are seeing in the business. Growth consumes cash for us as we normally are paying our employees ahead of getting paid from our clients. We also see a slight impact on the DSO from the price increase measures that we have successfully executed, where it takes a bit of time to conclude with the clients on these negotiations and then get back to normal again.\\r\\n We have a strong focus and attention in the divisions and in the countries to ensure we keep this on track in the second half year. Looking then at the free cash flow in Q2, which ended up at almost SEK 500 million. This is an improvement both in absolute and percentage terms compared to last year and was supported by reduced tax payments in the U.S. related to preliminary federal tax. Last year in Q2, we made larger true-up payments related to 2020, and this was now back to normal levels this year, having a positive impact when comparing the quarters. So we are reasonably satisfied with the second quarter cash flow. We are still behind for the first half year after the weaker Q1, where the main reasons was related to account receivables, where we had flat growth and a low DSO position at the end of last year, which impacted the first quarter.\\r\\n Last year, we also had positive payroll timing impacts in both the U.S. and The Netherlands of approximately SEK 600 million benefit in Q1. These payroll time and differences were neutral on a full-year basis 2021. Going forward, we should also remember that we will still pay the final SEK 600 million of corona-related time and relief measures that we benefited from in 2020 in North America, and this we will pay in Q4 this year.\\r\\n So we continue to have high focus on cash flow given the current macroeconomical environment and the Stanley transaction. Combined with the normal seasonality of a stronger second half year cash flow, we are working here to make sure we have a solid 2022 outcome here.\\r\\n We then go to the slide related to net debt. Our net debt increased with approximately SEK 3.9 billion in the first 6 months compared to the beginning of the year. The main reason for the increase is the regular dividend of SEK 1.6 billion paid in the second quarter. IAC related payments of close to SEK 500 million and a material FX translation impact of almost SEK 1.3 billion. Combining this with a negative free cash flow for the first half year and an increase in lease liabilities, mainly related to new office leases, the net debt ended up at SEK 18.4 million. Our net debt-to-EBITDA came in at 2.2%. This is flat compared to June last year, but with a 0.2% increase compared to Q1, mainly related to the regular dividend payment. As you know, our financial target is 2.5%, and we continue to be below this target preparing ahead of the Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n Moving on to the next slide and looking at our financial position and debt maturity short. As you know, we have a solid financing in place today. None of our facilities have any financial covenants and the liquidity position is strong. In April, we extended our EUR 938 million RCF for another year into 2027. And now in July, we added one more bank into the facility, increasing the number of banks to 11, and the total facility amount is then a bit more than EUR 1 billion, preparing here, of course, to become a larger group after the Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n As you also know since before, we have a bridge facility in place related to the USD 3.2 billion Stanley transaction, and we used this facility now on July 22 when paying the purchase price at closing. The bridge facility will be refinanced with a mix of debt and equity, where the rights issue will be approximately USD 950 million. We will launch the rights issue now in September, and there will be further details coming around this in the near-term future. We will thereafter also focus on the debt takeout where the exact timing is still to be decided.\\r\\n Looking at our rating. Here, we have been on credit watch by Standard &amp; Poor as a consequence of the announced Stanley transaction. As the transaction closed now, S&amp;P confirmed early this week that our update grading now is BBB minus with stable outlook, which was also in line with our expectations. So we reiterate our commitment to remain investment grade here, and we will focus on deleveraging our balance sheet going forward.\\r\\n And with that, I now hand back to Magnus.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [3]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Many thanks, Andreas. I would like to share just a few updates related to our transformation programs and the Stanley acquisition before we open up for the Q&amp;A. And starting with the transformation programs, we concluded the North American global IT programs at the end of 2021. And as previously mentioned, the investments made are now starting to generate returns, thanks to modern platforms and tools that enable us to optimize the business like never before. And we're also executing according to plan with the programs in Europe and Ibero-America. The European program is comprehensive. And if you're looking at the last 12 months, we have strengthened the solutions organization to drive improvement in the business mix. And during the coming 6 to 12 months, we're starting to transition to new systems and applications in some of the key markets.\\r\\n And all this work is fundamentally important to create a modern, digitally capable and more efficient Securitas. And this work also gives us a stronger foundation to leverage modern systems and applications when we are integrating the Stanley Security businesses.\\r\\n And a few words about Stanley. So by joining forces, we are building the foundation to be the leading intelligent security solutions partner. We become the most attractive choice for clients with a clearly differentiated offering and with world-leading technology and expertise. And technology is becoming increasingly important for our clients. And together with Stanley, we're shifting the profile of Securitas in terms of the offering to our clients and value creation. This is also immediately margin accretive. Over 50% of the contribution to operating results will come from higher value and higher growth solutions and Electronic Security.\\r\\n And we have received a tremendous response from our clients regarding the opportunities that this combination will bring. And together with Stanley, we are in a solid position to create an outstanding team, which is perfectly placed to win in the security services industry.\\r\\n So to conclude this, before we open up the Q&amp;A, we are executing on our strategy, and this is generating results. We increased the margin to 5.8% in the quarter and recorded 11% EPS growth in the first half of the year. And this is despite the turbulent external environment, and I am very proud of our team, which is delivering results today and at the same time, building the new Securitas. And that is the Securitas which is modern, digitized and innovative security solutions company.\\r\\n But before we open up to Q&amp;A, related to the Stanley acquisition, I understand that there is a lot of interest and questions. And for this reason, I would like to mention once again that we have arranged an Investor Update on August 24. And in that session, we will share an update of the strategy, a lot more detail related to the importance of the Stanley Security acquisition. And like I mentioned before, updated financial targets for the group.\\r\\n And by the 24th of August, we have also owned the business for a little bit more than a month. And my request today is that we then take all the Stanley-related questions in that session.\\r\\n So with that, happy to open up the Q&amp;A.\\r\\n================================================================================\\r\\nQuestions and Answers\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [1]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The first question comes from Kate Somerville at UBS.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Katherine Somerville,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst   [2]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I have 3, if I may. The first question is on the margin. I have estimated about -- near about 6 basis points of your margin improvement is from mix. And can you help us understand how much the remaining 14 basis points comes from the positive price/wage balance, the lost contracts and also your efficiency savings? That would be very helpful. My second question is on volumes. It seems as if volumes have slowed from being flat in Q1 to negative 3% in Q2. If you could give us any sort of color on what's driven that? And then finally, it seems that you've reduced the range for your items affecting comparability to SEK 550 million to SEK 600 million from -- from SEK 500 million to SEK 600 million to SEK 550 million to SEK 600 million. And should we expect any changes to the 2023 expectations?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [3]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. So thank you for the questions. On the margin, I mean, we are not breaking out the exact numbers behind. But when you're looking at this, I think, #1, we have had a consistent focus on ensuring that we are enhancing the profitability of the business. And this work is something that I think when you're looking at North America, even though we have organic sales growth, which is negative in the quarter, we are significantly expanding the margin. And that's a combination of a couple of different factors. One, of course, is portfolio management that we are carefully managing all contracts, and that is more important in this environment than ever before when there is labor scarcity. Another point is that the transformation program in North America is also operating -- I mean helping us to operate in a more efficient way. Another important driver is that we are driving very strong growth in terms of solutions and Electronic Security, which has a higher margin profile. And there, if you're looking at the overall group, 13% real sales growth compared to the same quarter last year. But then we've also undertaken quite a number of measures to make sure that we are running the business in a focused way, obviously, also have some positive impact from leverage in terms of the profitability, which is also helping thanks to the growth.\\r\\n Looking at the volume question, I'm not entirely sure that I understood the analysis there because if you're looking at the growth in the second quarter, there is a fairly significant piece, which is coming from price increases. That's the majority. There is also some volume growth in Europe and in Ibero-America, if you're looking at the portfolio. But one area that where we are significantly lower today compared to a year ago is in the extra sales. And we've highlighted that in 2020 and 2021, we were operating significantly higher extra sales levels, and that was most pronounced in North America, when you're looking at the decline between Q2 '21 to Q2 '22. So that is also one important factor, but there we're also expecting that extra sales, and we're also starting to see some indications that the kind of the normal extra sales that we would typically have, which is more event related, et cetera. I mean that is also gradually starting to come back.\\r\\n So I think that those are really the key points in terms of volume. But just to reiterate that point is that there is positive volume growth also excluding price increases in Europe and Ibero-America in the second quarter. So that is also a driver behind the growth.\\r\\n Maybe on the ISC, Andreas, if you want to comment on that one.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [4]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I can just add there on the margin as well. I mean, we had really strong price/wage management, as we have said here as well. So that is also contributing when you're looking at the margin improvements overall.\\r\\n On the items affecting comparability here, we gave a guidance of SEK 500 million to SEK 600 million in the previous quarter here. That was in the first quarter, of course. And then the further we're getting into the years, I mean the plan gets more and more clear. So then we can narrow down the forecast that we are seeing for the year. So you shouldn't see it as anything else than that. I mean we are now more confident that we will be around the SEK 550 million, SEK 600 million. So that's why we have made the window more narrow, and it's not any indications of changes for next year in any way.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [5]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Sylvia Barker at JPMorgan.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Sylvia Pavlova Barker,  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst   [6]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Question #1, I've got 3, please, if I may. Question #1, on provisions. I can see that they've reduced by about SEK 200 million on the balance sheet. And I know that you were still sitting on the SEK 530 million of COVID provisions at the end of Q1. So could you maybe just update us if anything has been released during the quarter? Question #2, just to understand, so the Turkey official inflation has picked up again in Q2 relative to Q1. So I'm making it out as being perhaps of the 300 basis points of your organic growth, but that seems a bit high. So can you maybe just give us some figures on how much Turkey and Argentina contributed to organic growth in the quarter?\\r\\n And then finally, on Electronics. So obviously, a bit difficult, but it seems like the organic overall for Electronic is still kind of neutral to maybe slightly negative if I look at the overall SS and ES sales in the quarter, excluding FX and acquisitions, could you maybe just comment on that figure and what you might see going forward?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [7]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Sylvia. I will take questions #2 and 3, and then I hand back to Andreas on the provisions. If you're looking at the Turkey inflation, that and Argentina, together, we estimate around 2% impact on the organic sales growth in the quarter, those 2 combined. On Electronic Security, important here, I mean, we had -- and it was a tough start of the year. And that was a mix of a couple of different factors. One was COVID-related. And COVID related, it's sick leave among our people, technicians, for example, to be able to carry out installation projects. Also then COVID-related in the sense that we had a number of clients also then not allowing, due to restrictions, then access to their premises. But we started to see this improving in the second quarter. And we expect that to continuously improve as well as the situation is hopefully normalizing.\\r\\n But the other aspect of this is also the component shortages because that is still a major factor when you're looking at the Electronic Security projects and installation business because there has been a lot of instability and not reliable or availability in terms of supply of components. So that has really had an impact. But we did have positive growth in North America in the second quarter. So that was positive. And we also had positive growth in Europe in the second quarter and also the 2 major ones in terms of the ES business.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [8]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Related to the provisions, basically, it's been a normal quarter here. So we have not touched any of the provisions that you mentioned here, Sylvia. And then, of course, you have ordinary course of business as well during the quarter. But related to the provisions we took in 2020, we have not touched those.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Sylvia Pavlova Barker,  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst   [9]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n And sorry, just in terms of other ones, then just the -- balance sheet reduction doesn't always match against what's happening in the P&amp;L. But is there anything else in any of the regions that's worth picking out or?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [10]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n No, I would say Sylvia it's been an ordinary quarter from that perspective. So there is nothing that is sticking out.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [11]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Anvesh Agrawal at Morgan Stanley.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Anvesh Agrawal,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst   [12]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I got 2 questions. First, just on the margin point further. I was just trying to understand how much really the transformation programs are contributing. So if you -- I mean, I calculated like half of the margin improvement or 10 basis points is coming from just from FX given the tailwinds you had? And then probably there is a little bit of mix benefit that was there. So just wondering how much this transformation programs are really contributing? Or if there is anything underlying, which is offsetting the impact. And I know you sort of answer the question of the Stanley deal later. But just on the bridge refinancing facility, I wanted to check whether it's on a fixed or a floating rate? And is there any upside risk to that exceptional item given how the interest rates have fared since you announced the deal, obviously?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [13]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Good. Thank you. So on the margin in North America, the transformation program is clearly helping. And just to give some flavor in terms of how? I mean, we have upgraded from old systems, very many ways of working to now be significant -- I mean, completely digitized end-to-end in terms of how we're working with -- in everything that we do in terms of our employees in the frontline, like officers, all the way to invoicing our clients. The big benefit here is that we have significantly better transparency and visibility, significantly better decision-making support for our leaders that are managing the business at different levels all the way out to equivalent of a branch manager. So that is clearly helping. And there, I mean, we had some benefit in 2021 -- it's difficult to break out the exact impact, but that benefit is definitely increasing in 2022 and really contributing to the very strong margin delivery. Because we're delivering this also in an external environment, which is really challenging from a labor scarcity perspective.\\r\\n So I think that is to provide some context in terms of the North America transformation program. When I look at Europe, when you're looking at Ibero-America, I mean, there we are at a much earlier stage in terms of the programs. I mentioned a little bit related to Europe that, I mean, there, it's much more than just harmonizing the way of working and upgrading systems and tools. It's also then really helping us starting to shape and change the business mix towards more integrated solutions. There, we have done quite some investments and also starting to see some positive results. And that is also helping and driving more solutions momentum in Europe, and that by itself also has a positive impact on the margin. But like I said, that program, it's much, much early days and more of the work, but also more of the benefit to come over the next couple of years.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [14]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Related to the bridge facility there, I mean first of all, the bridges are normal commercial terms, I would say, without going into the details there, but they are also long in nature here. We have up to 24 months in terms of duration on these bridges as well. So from that position, we're sitting in a good position. Then you can also say, of course, that we signed these bridge facilities in a different market back in 2021 as well, which is not the negative thing here, given the developments in the debt market since. So I hope that gives you some flavor here related to the bridge.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Anvesh Agrawal,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst   [15]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. I am sorry, maybe if I can just ask one, but just going back to -- I mean, we've seen the sort of pick up in the DSO and you said that it's essentially because of price rises and that takes time but once those are settled with the customer. I'm not sure I quite understood that. Like why would the price increase impact the DSOs?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [16]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Because basically, we go out to our clients then and need to make sure that we get the right price increases in place, like Magnus said here, it's a very dynamic market where we have also been pushing out fairly high price increases. And of course, that is always a discussion together with our clients, where you also need to agree in the end on the final number. So that takes a bit longer time than in a normal year, where it's less numbers and it's also more straightforward.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Anvesh Agrawal,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst   [17]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. I mean I can take it offline, but like it seems like you recognize revenue anyways and then sort of go for the final settlement with the clients.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [18]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n No. But that's not what I'm saying. It also takes longer time to negotiate as well, which is also then -- which is then also impacting the DSO. But the second point to highlight here as well, as I mentioned, if you're looking at the first half year is that we also had a very low DSO position by the end of last year, after a really strong cash print. So that is also impacting us here negatively as well. But then, of course, we need to make sure that we have a really solid also cash focus in the second quarter -- the second half year here as well.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [19]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Viktor Lindeberg, Carnegie.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Viktor Lindeberg,  Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Research Analyst   [20]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Actually, some were answered now, but following up on client retention. And excuse me if I missed this in the beginning, but you mentioned in North America, client retention rate goes from 90% to 85%. Is this purely related to the contracts that you have exited now in the past year? Or is there -- could you sort of provide us with an underlying number here? That's my first. Second question is then on the airport contract portfolio that you had during the pandemic strategic review of -- and now I guess Q2 has been more or less the first quarter with normalized operating conditions and volumes, give or take. So any conclusions you can share on this? Or how we should think about the airport contribution to the group as such?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [21]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you. Yes, your assumption is correct. That low retention rate is related to those low-margin contract terminations. And just to remind, they were very significant in size, around $50 million, an aviation contract that we terminated last summer. And then the other contract was around $150 million that we terminated in December 2021. So that is the reason. The commercial momentum in North America is really strong. We are selling at a high pace with the good margins. So I would say the commercial activity is positive. And I would also just emphasize as well is that, I mean, we are 100% focused on protecting the value of our business. When we talk about active portfolio management, we are not seeking to just add a lot of volume and volume, and volume. It has to be good margins and good values that we can defend the quality and also continues to invest in the relationship and the delivery with our clients. And we are sticking to that. And I think that is also working because we are defending, thanks to very good quality but also continuously strengthening the offering. And here, obviously, in the technology space as well and with the transformation programs, it also enables us to operate in a stronger way. So that is some of the flavors. So no concern whatsoever from my perspective in terms of client retention. But we're obviously always humble in terms of how we are working with the clients, but we are very firm in terms of the profitability requirements for the reasons I mentioned.\\r\\n The airport business, yes, that is now more normalized. And that contract portfolio, as you remember, we did very significant portfolio management and cleanup activities to make sure that we had a healthy portfolio during the worst part of the pandemic. We are now seeing the results of that. So when we're looking from a profitability perspective, that profitability is now up and in line with the group average more or less. So it's a better quality portfolio when things are now hopefully normalizing as we're coming out of the worst year from the pandemic.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Viktor Lindeberg,  Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Research Analyst   [22]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n And maybe final from my side. Your slide at the very end, Magnus, on the transformation programs and the benefits you expect in Europe by 2024. I understand part of the margin accretion is going to come from M&amp;A. And now, we have the Stanley acquisition, obviously, but you also now say you put M&amp;A on hold for the time being, given focus and obviously leverage. But how should we read that in that context, given that M&amp;A was expected to contribute now that maybe not will happen as much. Obviously, Stanley is accretive in itself, but just trying to figure out the bits and pieces here on that.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [23]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n So when you're looking at that, I mean, we feel good about the ambition there and our ability to be able to deliver on the margin improvement. We are obviously significantly accelerating the transformation and realization of the strategy with the acquisition of Stanley Security. There are 9 markets in Europe, where we are building a real position of strength either by combining Electronic Security, existing that we have or building, and that will definitely also help the overall case. So no concerns in terms of temporary -- I mean, I think, it's just a prudent thing to do that we now have significant integration and creation effort ahead of us in terms of really integrating Stanley over the next 3, 6, 12 months, but we will also have a significantly stronger offering to the clients and more future-proof position, which I think is important as well because technology is just becoming more and more important and even more so when you're looking at the challenges that we're seeing in the labor market, just finding people. So yes, I hope that answers your question.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [24]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Allen Wells at Jefferies.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Allen David Wells,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst   [25]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Just 2 for me. Just firstly, you talked a little bit about the extra sales declines from the numbers we saw during COVID. Is there any way you can try and help us by quantifying the step down you're still seeing versus last year? And also I'd be interested just to hear about where we are in those extra sales versus the pre-COVID levels, i.e., you sort of suggested it was kind of normalizing, but is that back at the kind of pre-COVID levels. Now that's the first question. And then secondly, just to follow back on the organic growth breakdown or kind of the building blocks. You said that 2% was hyperinflation. But maybe can you split the rest between what's normal price increases? Maybe what's kind of COVID recovery and then what's underlying volume growth in there as well. So that type of split would be really helpful.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [26]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Allen. So I mean to be specific on the extra sales, it's roughly 3% less as the share of sales this year compared to last year. So a significant reduction. And that is most pronounced in North America in the second quarter because there we were also running with significantly higher COVID-related extra sales in Q2 last year. And that is -- I mean that business is no longer there. So I think that -- and to your second question, related to the extra sales, we are now at levels that are more kind of normal levels. Some quarters, it's going to be a little bit higher than where we are right now. If we're looking -- if the past is a good guidance related to the future. And we're also starting to see that, that more and more events are starting to come back, but it's also been a little bit tentative. If you're looking at the things that we are doing, AGMs, for example, we might be doing quite a lot of when it's AGM season, sports events, other industry type of events across different verticals, et cetera. And those, as you know, in some areas, they've kind of started to resume normal activity in some areas not. And those are obviously activities that we will typically also benefit our extra sales and even if on a temporary basis. But that's also the whole definition of the extra sales of the temp business, as we call it. So I hope that gives the flavor. But on a year-on-year basis, around 3% less as a percentage of sales compared to last year's same period.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [27]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I can add on there, related to the extra sales. I mean, in normal years, we normally are around 13% to 15% extra sales. And now, we are at 13%. So I would say we are sort of at the bottom of the normal range here as well -- as Magnus is saying here, there are AGMs and other type of temporary business that starts to increase going forward as well. So it might be that we have an opportunity here going forward to be a bit higher than we were in Q2. When it comes to then the organic sales growth overall, I mean looking at this, we would say, overall, around 4%, a bit less than that, we would estimate to be price increases and -- sorry, between 4% and 5%, I should say. We estimate to be around price increases and the remaining we see as volume here. And that is then derived from the aviation business recovery, the portfolio growth that we've seen in Europe and Iberia America, but also the strong Electronic Security and Solutions here as well.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [28]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Karl-Johan Bonnevier at DNB Markets.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Karl-Johan Bonnevier,  DNB Markets, Research Division - Analyst   [29]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I appreciate that you want to wait on talking Stanley until the 24th of August and looking forward to that event. But it would be interesting to hear your comments about the 5 countries that you acquired now in 2020. What -- from Stanley, what have you seen in those countries? How have you been able to integrate it? And what kind of impact? And what have you learned, so to say, about the quality of the Stanley after that?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [30]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Karl-Johan. So when you look at those, and I would also include the case in Spain, a company that we acquired at the beginning of 2020 called TECO, that was also a previous Stanley or Niscayah business. What are the common denominators. Well, first of all, we have built more critical mass in most of those markets in terms of Electronic Security and technology capability. And I mentioned that because that is important for relevance in terms of the types of clients and the types of projects that we can take on. So I think that is one because there has been a credibility aspect of this in front of the client that they know that you have the competence, you have the design and the project skills, you have the installations, service and maintenance capabilities to really take on and help us as a client with these types of products. So I think that has been a very important one. And that we have also then seen that, that in combination with back-end synergies. And I mean here, we have been very clear that synergies more to be realized in the back end so that we're protecting commercial capability and resources, we're protecting technical capability engineers, but then trying to make sure that we are driving more common and efficiency as well in the back end. And that has also then meant that in a number of the cases, we have also been able to significantly not only strengthen the market position and the offering but also significant lift in terms of the profitability.\\r\\n And the experience that we have from those 5 plus the sixth one being in Spain, it's highly relevant and also was a strong driver and the reason for our confidence as well about how good it is for us to do this strategic acquisition because it is really a game changer for Securitas, when you're looking at the acquisition that we are doing. And that is very much based on not only on the factors that I mentioned, but also when you're looking at people and culture and what the importance is for a business of also belonging to a company where security and safety is the core. Because that is the important part, and it's also something I've been talking to many of the colleagues as well from Stanley over the last couple of days. When we have welcomed them where we're now joining forces is that they are joining a company where we have 100% focus on security and safety and being at the best in this industry, in this field. And I think that is something that shouldn't be underestimated in terms of the importance for long-term value creation.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Karl-Johan Bonnevier,  DNB Markets, Research Division - Analyst   [31]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Sounds like good premarketing for the 24th. Andreas, just on that note as well, I guess all of us will focus on the deleveraging component, going forward. And when we look at, say, the normal seasonal pattern, obviously, Securitas has a much stronger free cash flow generation in the second half. If you take your comments on organic growth driving some working capital and then there's extra settlement payment in the U.S., is there any reason, if you think about those to not expect Securitas to have a good free cash flow in the second half of this year?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [32]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n So those are 2 components impacting, you're right about that. But in the end, this will also be very much about the work that we can do together with the team in the second half year, which we have done previous years as well, to make sure we get strong collections coming in during the second half and basically work on our DSO list as well because that is the main driver, of course, to our cash flow there, as well. So it is up to us to get back into a normal position here that we have also been able to do in previous years as well. But you're right, we have these 2 components to handle as well in the second half year. So...\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Karl-Johan Bonnevier,  DNB Markets, Research Division - Analyst   [33]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n And your definition of being a good investment case would that be below 3x net debt to EBITDA? Or how would you quantify it?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [34]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n At what point -- at what point in time are you referring to now?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Karl-Johan Bonnevier,  DNB Markets, Research Division - Analyst   [35]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n No, no, not point. Just what level would you consider being good investment grade for your business?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [36]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n But I think exactly -- this will be, of course, one component of interest, and this is exactly something we will come back to here in August, but we will give you a full brief around that instead of commenting around that individually here now.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [37]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Stefan Knutsson of ABG.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Stefan Knutsson,  ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA, Research Division - Research Analyst   [38]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n My question is regarding the Ibero-America and the operating margin that you already performed there. You're approaching the 6.0% that you aim for in the transformation program. Is it time to raise the ambition or how do you view it?\\r\\n And then the second question is regarding the Stanley acquisition. And since you have closed the acquisition now, can you give any guidance on how much you see will go as amortization of intangibles going forward?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [39]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. Thank you. So on Ibero-America, it is true what you are reflecting on here. I mean, we are performing, I would say, driving improvements at a faster pace than what we would have anticipated. So that obviously then is yes. That's the simple reality. But we will also, when we are talking on the 24th, also provide new financial targets, I think it's prudent as well that we then come back and comment. And I promise to come back to that question in some more detail also in that update.\\r\\n And just on the second question, I mean the strategic logic is strong here. We feel very good, like I said, about the value creation case. We will provide a lot more detail on the 24th. But Andreas, maybe you have just one brief comment here before we continue.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [40]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. You have -- in the report here, you have an estimate related to the amortization of acquisition intangibles. And this is preliminary, of course. But the total amount allocated here is around USD 500 million, mainly then related to customer portfolio, which will be amortized over 15 years. So you will approximately have an amortization charge per year of USD 35 million, still being preliminary, but the information is there in Note 2 as well.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [41]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n (Operator Instructions) There are no further questions at this time. Please go ahead, speakers.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [42]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I can also just come back to Sylvia here who had a question around the provision line in itself. And I think I gave the overall answer, and that still stands. But I just want to make it clear there that the bad debt provisions that we took in 2020 are not on the line provisions here. That is a reduction of account receivables. So there is no connection there. And then the movement on the provision line is related to a reduction in our pension liabilities, given the increased interest rate environment here as well. And that is something that goes through equity and not the income statement, to be clear there as well.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [43]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Good. So unless there are any further questions, thank you, everyone, for your engagement. And as we said before, we're looking forward to seeing you for the event on the 24th of August. And in the meantime, everyone in the Northern Hemisphere, wishing then good continued hopefully summer time. Thank you.\\r\\n\",\n",

       "   'text': \"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter call. We continue to execute on our strategy, and this is generating results. When looking at the quarter, we increased the business momentum, continued margin improvement and profit growth. The organic sales growth increased to 6% with strong growth in Europe and Ibero-America. We had negative growth as expected in North America, but are now turning the corner and expecting to return to positive growth in the third quarter. The operating margin increased to 5.8%, and we're now almost 1% higher margin when comparing with the pre-COVID years.\\r\\n North America and Ibero-America are the main contributors and the margin in Europe was stable when comparing to the same period last year. But the external environment continues to be challenging in terms of labor scarcity and inflation, but we are managing well and have a positive price/wage balance year-to-date. And given the circumstances, we will continue to work with dynamic price increases to balance wage increases and importantly, to safeguard the quality of our delivery to our clients.\\r\\n And as is visible in the numbers, a strong focus on improving profitability is now starting to generate real results. We had 13% real sales growth in solutions and Electronic Security, which is a very strong performance with good growth across all segments. And our offering is strong, and we are winning more business at improved margins versus last year. And this, in combination with portfolio management and the impacts from the transformation programs is resulting in higher profitability.\\r\\n And last but not least, we are very proud that Securitas, as the first major security services company, has committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative. Sustainability has always been a focus here at Securitas, but this is further proof of our commitment to continue to deliver sustainable security and safety services and leading the industry also in this important aspect.\\r\\n And as you have hopefully noticed, we were also very glad to announce last week that we have now closed the Stanley Security. And the joint integration preparation work has been solid, and we are very happy and ready to join forces now with the Stanley Security team. And we have planned for an investor update on August 24 to share more about the strategy of the group with new financial targets, and I hope that you are able to join us virtually for that session.\\r\\n So with that, let us now turn in the different business segments. And starting with North America, where, as expected, we did have negative organic growth in the quarter due to the termination of announced low-margin contracts, but also a very significant reduction in COVID-related extra sales compared with the same period last year. But we have good underlying momentum in the North American business. New sales are strong in the Guarding business, and we're managing price increases successfully and in a dynamic manner.\\r\\n The Electronic Security installation business improved in Q2 after a challenging start to the year, but we're still facing challenges related to component shortage and labor shortage. But it is important to note that we had positive organic sales growth, strong order intake and record level backlog in the quarter.\\r\\n And our Pinkerton risk management business is also growing at a healthy pace and contributing. So based on this underlying strength, we are expecting to return to positive organic sales growth in the third quarter.\\r\\n And looking then at the profitability, the margin expansion in North America continues with improvements supported by all business units. The operating margin of 7.4% is the highest ever achieved in North America. And there are a number of reasons behind this. And starting with the Guarding business, there are a few key drivers behind the positive development. The business transformation program that we finished last year, active portfolio management and an increase in solution sales are all contributing to the positive development.\\r\\n Looking at Electronic Security, we had an improved business mix and also solid execution by our team, and that also contributed to the results. The development of our Pinkerton business was also solid, and we also had a positive contribution from the Critical Infrastructure Services business.\\r\\n So when you're looking at North America, we have undertaken significant modernization and digitization on North America business with significant investments over the last couple of years. And our team's execution of the strategy is now generating results with structurally higher margins.\\r\\n So with that, let us then shift the focus to Europe, where we had very strong growth of 9% in the quarter. And there are a few factors contributing to the growth. First, we had positive portfolio development. So that means the strong commercial momentum is resulting in positive portfolio growth also when excluding price increases. Secondly, the aviation business is returning to more normalized levels of demand. This also contributed. And third, we are increasing prices at significantly higher rates than normal to balance wage increases.\\r\\n But I'm also very glad to report that we had solid growth in sales of Solutions and Electronic Security in Europe in the quarter, and that also had a real positive impact on the sales growth.\\r\\n And looking at the profitability, the margin of 5.5% was stable versus the same quarter last year despite the challenges related to sickness and labor shortages. At active portfolio management as well as previously acquired Electronic Security businesses contributed positively to the margin.\\r\\n Sickness rates and the cost related to labor shortages improved somewhat versus the first quarter but are still impacting the bottom line in a negative way. And as was the case in the first quarter, these challenges are more pronounced in a few markets in Europe and in the rest of the countries, we are managing quite well.\\r\\n Cost measures and some leverage from the strong growth also helped the margin. So when looking ahead, we expect the labor market in Europe to remain challenging, and we continue to work in a more dynamic manner to balance wage increases with price increases. And apart from that, we're also actively promoting connected technology and integrated solutions to our clients as a means to improve the security equation and managing total cost for our clients.\\r\\n And moving then to Ibero-America, where we have continued very positive development in terms of top line growth but also profitability. And in Spain, we had organic sales growth of 10% in the quarter with a strong development across the business. Latin America improved compared to last year, but price increases in Argentina were the primary driver from a Latin American perspective, contribution to the growth. And the good momentum with sales of Security Solutions and Electronic Security continued. These sales are now representing 30% of total sales.\\r\\n But we also have very strong development in terms of profitability. Our Ibero-America team are executing on the strategy, create a sharper and more profitable business, and this is paying off. The operating margin is 40 to 50 basis points higher versus the same period last year and more than 1% higher when comparing with the pre-COVID periods. And the improvement is driven by Spain, Portugal, but we also had positive contribution from most countries in Latin America that are performing at a higher level.\\r\\n So all in all, a strong quarter, strong continued development of the overall business. And I think with that, I hand over to Andreas for some more details regarding the financials.\"},\n",

       "   'text': \"Thank you, Magnus, and good afternoon, everyone. We start, as always, with our income statement here. The second quarter was as Magnus mentioned, a strong quarter with solid growth and an improving operating margin at 5.8%.\\r\\n The operating margin is not only strong when comparing to last year, but also substantially higher than the pre-COVID Q2 levels at around 5%, confirming that our execution of the strategy is on the right way. The margin development was supported by strong double-digit growth in the high-margin solutions and Electronic Security business. And the teams have done a really good job with the price/wage balance, which so far in the year are contributing to the margin.\\r\\n I should highlight that the operating result in the second quarter did not include any material government grants related to COVID-19 and the number of people on temporary unemployment was on very low levels. One accounting update, here in the second quarter, is that Turkey, as from April 1, is considered hyperinflationary for the purpose of the reporting under IAS 29 hyperinflation. As you know, we have also applied IAS 29 for our operations in Argentina since Q3 2018. It is a straightforward standard from the perspective that it targets to give better insight into the effect from high inflation, both related to the balance sheet and the income statement. The implementation of this standard is, however, fairly technical in nature. And to keep it simple here related to Turkey, the impact on Securitas is not material, as you can also see on Page 9 in the report under the table for security services Europe. The impact on the balance sheet related to Turkey is an increase in capital employed of SEK 463 million and the same amount increased in equity. That relates to the revaluation that we then do on the opening balance sheet on April 1. Then during the quarter, we have reevaluated the income statement and the balance sheet as well. The conclusion of that is that there is almost no effect on sales nor operating results. The most significant impact is within the financial items line with a positive effect of SEK 17 million. We have continued to treat the effects from the standard similar to currency impact. This means that none of our key ratios, such as organic growth or real change are impacted from bringing Turkey in. You'll find more details around this in Note 8 of the report.\\r\\n If we then have a look below the operating result. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was SEK 61 million in the quarter, basically the same number as in the first quarter and nothing major to report here.\\r\\n Looking at the acquisition-related costs, they were again limited in the quarter as our acquisition activity is reduced after the announcement of the Stanley transaction. We have posted acquisitions to focus on the Stanley integration and deleveraging of our balance sheet position. There may be 1 or 2 smaller exceptions to this, but there will be nothing major in the coming quarters. So we expect the acquisition-related costs to be lower than 2021 for the full year. Remember here that the acquisition costs related to Stanley is reported under items affecting comparability.\\r\\n Going then to exactly that, items affecting comparability. Here, we had SEK 226 million of cost in the quarter, which is approximately SEK 30 million less than last year. The reduction is a consequence of us closing down 3 programs at the end of 2021. Of the SEK 226 million, SEK 169 million was related to the ongoing European and Ibero-America transformation programs and the residual SEK 57 million was paid transaction costs related to the Stanley acquisition. And I will come back with some more information here on the next page.\\r\\n If we then have a look at the financial net. Here, we had a SEK 30 million reduction in cost in the quarter. The underlying interest cost increased somewhat due to the increased interest rates that we are seeing, but we had some smaller positive FX impacts and together with around SEK 30 million positive impact from IAS-29. That explains the difference here.\\r\\n As I mentioned earlier, SEK 17 million is related to Turkey and the residual is related to Argentina, referencing then the SEK 30 million IAS-29 impact. Given the high inflation and increased interest rate in the market, we are expecting to see an increased financial net for the full year 2022, when we compare to 2021, also then excluding the impacts of the hyperinflation. This is, of course, also excluding the finance costs related to Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n Looking at the tax. The tax rate forecast for the full year remains at 27.0%, and there are basically no major news in this forecast.\\r\\n On the next slide, we have some additional information related then to the programs we are running under items affecting comparability. Important here is that we closed down 3 programs at the end of last year, which is reducing the complexity here. In North America, the team is continuing to execute on realizing the benefits from the North America transformation program that we implemented last year. We see positive margin impacts from the program in 2022, and there is further potential here going forward. The European and Ibero-America transformation programs are continuing the execution. The programs are on track, and we will, over the coming quarters, start to go live in phases with new digital platforms in several countries. We have an important year ahead of us in terms of execution here.\\r\\n The items affecting comparability related to these programs were SEK 169 million in the second quarter, and our estimate for the full year is between SEK 550 million and SEK 600 million. And this then also includes the impact from the cloud computing accounting regulations implemented and communicated in Q4.\\r\\n We have, as I mentioned, also occurred SEK 57 million of costs related to the Stanley acquisition in the quarter. Totally, since the announcement, we have spent SEK 132 million of the approximately SEK 1.4 billion transaction integration and restructuring costs related to the acquisition. The plan is that the majority of these costs will be expensed over 2022 and 2023.\\r\\n Moving then to the next page, where we have an overview of the FX impact on the income statement. There were major impacts from FX in the quarter, mainly related to the U.S. dollar that appreciated 19% to the Swedish krona compared to last year. The total FX impact on sales was 9% in the second quarter, mainly then driven by the U.S. dollar, while the euro appreciated 5%.\\r\\n Looking at our operating result, the FX impact was a bit higher at 12%, mainly due to the higher profitability levels in our North American business and the currency impact increased further when looking at EPS. The EPS real change before items affecting comparability was solid at 10% in the quarter and 11% for the first 6 months with good cost leverage on the items below operating result. Including the items affecting comparability, the real change was even a bit stronger coming from the reduced IC spend this year.\\r\\n We then move to cash flow. The cash flow from operating activities was SEK 927 million or 53% of the operating result in the second quarter, a good improvement compared to the first quarter and a solid Q2 outcome, taking into consideration the current high growth that we are seeing in the business. If we look into the larger movements here in the quarter, we saw an increase in CapEx of almost SEK 190 million. We saw an increase in our investments into our solution contracts, which confirms the positive momentum we have in the high-margin solutions business. A major part of the increase was also related to the existing transformation programs, which are progressing according to plan.\\r\\n The CapEx to sales was 2.8% in the quarter, and we continue to expect to come in below 3% for the year. The account receivables was minus SEK 873 million. And here, we see the impact from the strong growth that we are seeing in the business. Growth consumes cash for us as we normally are paying our employees ahead of getting paid from our clients. We also see a slight impact on the DSO from the price increase measures that we have successfully executed, where it takes a bit of time to conclude with the clients on these negotiations and then get back to normal again.\\r\\n We have a strong focus and attention in the divisions and in the countries to ensure we keep this on track in the second half year. Looking then at the free cash flow in Q2, which ended up at almost SEK 500 million. This is an improvement both in absolute and percentage terms compared to last year and was supported by reduced tax payments in the U.S. related to preliminary federal tax. Last year in Q2, we made larger true-up payments related to 2020, and this was now back to normal levels this year, having a positive impact when comparing the quarters. So we are reasonably satisfied with the second quarter cash flow. We are still behind for the first half year after the weaker Q1, where the main reasons was related to account receivables, where we had flat growth and a low DSO position at the end of last year, which impacted the first quarter.\\r\\n Last year, we also had positive payroll timing impacts in both the U.S. and The Netherlands of approximately SEK 600 million benefit in Q1. These payroll time and differences were neutral on a full-year basis 2021. Going forward, we should also remember that we will still pay the final SEK 600 million of corona-related time and relief measures that we benefited from in 2020 in North America, and this we will pay in Q4 this year.\\r\\n So we continue to have high focus on cash flow given the current macroeconomical environment and the Stanley transaction. Combined with the normal seasonality of a stronger second half year cash flow, we are working here to make sure we have a solid 2022 outcome here.\\r\\n We then go to the slide related to net debt. Our net debt increased with approximately SEK 3.9 billion in the first 6 months compared to the beginning of the year. The main reason for the increase is the regular dividend of SEK 1.6 billion paid in the second quarter. IAC related payments of close to SEK 500 million and a material FX translation impact of almost SEK 1.3 billion. Combining this with a negative free cash flow for the first half year and an increase in lease liabilities, mainly related to new office leases, the net debt ended up at SEK 18.4 million. Our net debt-to-EBITDA came in at 2.2%. This is flat compared to June last year, but with a 0.2% increase compared to Q1, mainly related to the regular dividend payment. As you know, our financial target is 2.5%, and we continue to be below this target preparing ahead of the Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n Moving on to the next slide and looking at our financial position and debt maturity short. As you know, we have a solid financing in place today. None of our facilities have any financial covenants and the liquidity position is strong. In April, we extended our EUR 938 million RCF for another year into 2027. And now in July, we added one more bank into the facility, increasing the number of banks to 11, and the total facility amount is then a bit more than EUR 1 billion, preparing here, of course, to become a larger group after the Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n As you also know since before, we have a bridge facility in place related to the USD 3.2 billion Stanley transaction, and we used this facility now on July 22 when paying the purchase price at closing. The bridge facility will be refinanced with a mix of debt and equity, where the rights issue will be approximately USD 950 million. We will launch the rights issue now in September, and there will be further details coming around this in the near-term future. We will thereafter also focus on the debt takeout where the exact timing is still to be decided.\\r\\n Looking at our rating. Here, we have been on credit watch by Standard &amp; Poor as a consequence of the announced Stanley transaction. As the transaction closed now, S&amp;P confirmed early this week that our update grading now is BBB minus with stable outlook, which was also in line with our expectations. So we reiterate our commitment to remain investment grade here, and we will focus on deleveraging our balance sheet going forward.\\r\\n And with that, I now hand back to Magnus.\"},\n",

       "   'text': \"Many thanks, Andreas. I would like to share just a few updates related to our transformation programs and the Stanley acquisition before we open up for the Q&amp;A. And starting with the transformation programs, we concluded the North American global IT programs at the end of 2021. And as previously mentioned, the investments made are now starting to generate returns, thanks to modern platforms and tools that enable us to optimize the business like never before. And we're also executing according to plan with the programs in Europe and Ibero-America. The European program is comprehensive. And if you're looking at the last 12 months, we have strengthened the solutions organization to drive improvement in the business mix. And during the coming 6 to 12 months, we're starting to transition to new systems and applications in some of the key markets.\\r\\n And all this work is fundamentally important to create a modern, digitally capable and more efficient Securitas. And this work also gives us a stronger foundation to leverage modern systems and applications when we are integrating the Stanley Security businesses.\\r\\n And a few words about Stanley. So by joining forces, we are building the foundation to be the leading intelligent security solutions partner. We become the most attractive choice for clients with a clearly differentiated offering and with world-leading technology and expertise. And technology is becoming increasingly important for our clients. And together with Stanley, we're shifting the profile of Securitas in terms of the offering to our clients and value creation. This is also immediately margin accretive. Over 50% of the contribution to operating results will come from higher value and higher growth solutions and Electronic Security.\\r\\n And we have received a tremendous response from our clients regarding the opportunities that this combination will bring. And together with Stanley, we are in a solid position to create an outstanding team, which is perfectly placed to win in the security services industry.\\r\\n So to conclude this, before we open up the Q&amp;A, we are executing on our strategy, and this is generating results. We increased the margin to 5.8% in the quarter and recorded 11% EPS growth in the first half of the year. And this is despite the turbulent external environment, and I am very proud of our team, which is delivering results today and at the same time, building the new Securitas. And that is the Securitas which is modern, digitized and innovative security solutions company.\\r\\n But before we open up to Q&amp;A, related to the Stanley acquisition, I understand that there is a lot of interest and questions. And for this reason, I would like to mention once again that we have arranged an Investor Update on August 24. And in that session, we will share an update of the strategy, a lot more detail related to the importance of the Stanley Security acquisition. And like I mentioned before, updated financial targets for the group.\\r\\n And by the 24th of August, we have also owned the business for a little bit more than a month. And my request today is that we then take all the Stanley-related questions in that session.\\r\\n So with that, happy to open up the Q&amp;A.\"}],\n",
       " 'presentation_colapsed': \"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter call. We continue to execute on our strategy, and this is generating results. When looking at the quarter, we increased the business momentum, continued margin improvement and profit growth. The organic sales growth increased to 6% with strong growth in Europe and Ibero-America. We had negative growth as expected in North America, but are now turning the corner and expecting to return to positive growth in the third quarter. The operating margin increased to 5.8%, and we're now almost 1% higher margin when comparing with the pre-COVID years.\\r\\n North America and Ibero-America are the main contributors and the margin in Europe was stable when comparing to the same period last year. But the external environment continues to be challenging in terms of labor scarcity and inflation, but we are managing well and have a positive price/wage balance year-to-date. And given the circumstances, we will continue to work with dynamic price increases to balance wage increases and importantly, to safeguard the quality of our delivery to our clients.\\r\\n And as is visible in the numbers, a strong focus on improving profitability is now starting to generate real results. We had 13% real sales growth in solutions and Electronic Security, which is a very strong performance with good growth across all segments. And our offering is strong, and we are winning more business at improved margins versus last year. And this, in combination with portfolio management and the impacts from the transformation programs is resulting in higher profitability.\\r\\n And last but not least, we are very proud that Securitas, as the first major security services company, has committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative.

The EPS real change before items affecting comparability was solid at 10% in the quarter and 11% for the first 6 months with good cost leverage on the items below operating result. Including the items affecting comparability, the real change was even a bit stronger coming from the reduced IC spend this year.\\r\\n We then move to cash flow. The cash flow from operating activities was SEK 927 million or 53% of the operating result in the second quarter, a good improvement compared to the first quarter and a solid Q2 outcome, taking into consideration the current high growth that we are seeing in the business. If we look into the larger movements here in the quarter, we saw an increase in CapEx of almost SEK 190 million. We saw an increase in our investments into our solution contracts, which confirms the positive momentum we have in the high-margin solutions business. A major part of the increase was also related to the existing transformation programs, which are progressing according to plan.\\r\\n The CapEx to sales was 2.8% in the quarter, and we continue to expect to come in below 3% for the year. The account receivables was minus SEK 873 million. And here, we see the impact from the strong growth that we are seeing in the business. Growth consumes cash for us as we normally are paying our employees ahead of getting paid from our clients. We also see a slight impact on the DSO from the price increase measures that we have successfully executed, where it takes a bit of time to conclude with the clients on these negotiations and then get back to normal again.\\r\\n We have a strong focus and attention in the divisions and in the countries to ensure we keep this on track in the second half year. Looking then at the free cash flow in Q2, which ended up at almost SEK 500 million. This is an improvement both in absolute and percentage terms compared to last year and was supported by reduced tax payments in the U.S. related to preliminary federal tax. Last year in Q2, we made larger true-up payments related to 2020, and this was now back to normal levels this year, having a positive impact when comparing the quarters. So we are reasonably satisfied with the second quarter cash flow. We are still behind for the first half year after the weaker Q1, where the main reasons was related to account receivables, where we had flat growth and a low DSO position at the end of last year, which impacted the first quarter.\\r\\n Last year, we also had positive payroll timing impacts in both the U.S. and The Netherlands of approximately SEK 600 million benefit in Q1. These payroll time and differences were neutral on a full-year basis 2021. Going forward, we should also remember that we will still pay the final SEK 600 million of corona-related time and relief measures that we benefited from in 2020 in North America, and this we will pay in Q4 this year.\\r\\n So we continue to have high focus on cash flow given the current macroeconomical environment and the Stanley transaction. Combined with the normal seasonality of a stronger second half year cash flow, we are working here to make sure we have a solid 2022 outcome here.\\r\\n We then go to the slide related to net debt. Our net debt increased with approximately SEK 3.9 billion in the first 6 months compared to the beginning of the year. The main reason for the increase is the regular dividend of SEK 1.6 billion paid in the second quarter. IAC related payments of close to SEK 500 million and a material FX translation impact of almost SEK 1.3 billion. Combining this with a negative free cash flow for the first half year and an increase in lease liabilities, mainly related to new office leases, the net debt ended up at SEK 18.4 million. Our net debt-to-EBITDA came in at 2.2%. This is flat compared to June last year, but with a 0.2% increase compared to Q1, mainly related to the regular dividend payment. As you know, our financial target is 2.5%, and we continue to be below this target preparing ahead of the Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n Moving on to the next slide and looking at our financial position and debt maturity short. As you know, we have a solid financing in place today. None of our facilities have any financial covenants and the liquidity position is strong. In April, we extended our EUR 938 million RCF for another year into 2027. And now in July, we added one more bank into the facility, increasing the number of banks to 11, and the total facility amount is then a bit more than EUR 1 billion, preparing here, of course, to become a larger group after the Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n As you also know since before, we have a bridge facility in place related to the USD 3.2 billion Stanley transaction, and we used this facility now on July 22 when paying the purchase price at closing. The bridge facility will be refinanced with a mix of debt and equity, where the rights issue will be approximately USD 950 million. We will launch the rights issue now in September, and there will be further details coming around this in the near-term future. We will thereafter also focus on the debt takeout where the exact timing is still to be decided.\\r\\n Looking at our rating. Here, we have been on credit watch by Standard &amp; Poor as a consequence of the announced Stanley transaction. As the transaction closed now, S&amp;P confirmed early this week that our update grading now is BBB minus with stable outlook, which was also in line with our expectations. So we reiterate our commitment to remain investment grade here, and we will focus on deleveraging our balance sheet going forward.\\r\\n And with that, I now hand back to Magnus. Many thanks, Andreas. I would like to share just a few updates related to our transformation programs and the Stanley acquisition before we open up for the Q&amp;A. And starting with the transformation programs, we concluded the North American global IT programs at the end of 2021. And as previously mentioned, the investments made are now starting to generate returns, thanks to modern platforms and tools that enable us to optimize the business like never before. And we're also executing according to plan with the programs in Europe and Ibero-America. The European program is comprehensive. And if you're looking at the last 12 months, we have strengthened the solutions organization to drive improvement in the business mix. And during the coming 6 to 12 months, we're starting to transition to new systems and applications in some of the key markets.\\r\\n And all this work is fundamentally important to create a modern, digitally capable and more efficient Securitas. And this work also gives us a stronger foundation to leverage modern systems and applications when we are integrating the Stanley Security businesses.\\r\\n And a few words about Stanley. So by joining forces, we are building the foundation to be the leading intelligent security solutions partner. We become the most attractive choice for clients with a clearly differentiated offering and with world-leading technology and expertise. And technology is becoming increasingly important for our clients. And together with Stanley, we're shifting the profile of Securitas in terms of the offering to our clients and value creation. This is also immediately margin accretive. Over 50% of the contribution to operating results will come from higher value and higher growth solutions and Electronic Security.\\r\\n And we have received a tremendous response from our clients regarding the opportunities that this combination will bring. And together with Stanley, we are in a solid position to create an outstanding team, which is perfectly placed to win in the security services industry.\\r\\n So to conclude this, before we open up the Q&amp;A, we are executing on our strategy, and this is generating results. We increased the margin to 5.8% in the quarter and recorded 11% EPS growth in the first half of the year. And this is despite the turbulent external environment, and I am very proud of our team, which is delivering results today and at the same time, building the new Securitas. And that is the Securitas which is modern, digitized and innovative security solutions company.\\r\\n But before we open up to Q&amp;A, related to the Stanley acquisition, I understand that there is a lot of interest and questions. And for this reason, I would like to mention once again that we have arranged an Investor Update on August 24. And in that session, we will share an update of the strategy, a lot more detail related to the importance of the Stanley Security acquisition. And like I mentioned before, updated financial targets for the group.\\r\\n And by the 24th of August, we have also owned the business for a little bit more than a month. And my request today is that we then take all the Stanley-related questions in that session.\\r\\n So with that, happy to open up the Q&amp;A.\",\n",

My second question is on volumes. It seems as if volumes have slowed from being flat in Q1 to negative 3% in Q2. If you could give us any sort of color on what's driven that? And then finally, it seems that you've reduced the range for your items affecting comparability to SEK 550 million to SEK 600 million from -- from SEK 500 million to SEK 600 million to SEK 550 million to SEK 600 million.

       "   'text': \"Yes. So thank you for the questions. On the margin, I mean, we are not breaking out the exact numbers behind. But when you're looking at this, I think, #1, we have had a consistent focus on ensuring that we are enhancing the profitability of the business. And this work is something that I think when you're looking at North America, even though we have organic sales growth, which is negative in the quarter, we are significantly expanding the margin. And that's a combination of a couple of different factors. One, of course, is portfolio management that we are carefully managing all contracts, and that is more important in this environment than ever before when there is labor scarcity. Another point is that the transformation program in North America is also operating -- I mean helping us to operate in a more efficient way. Another important driver is that we are driving very strong growth in terms of solutions and Electronic Security, which has a higher margin profile. And there, if you're looking at the overall group, 13% real sales growth compared to the same quarter last year. But then we've also undertaken quite a number of measures to make sure that we are running the business in a focused way, obviously, also have some positive impact from leverage in terms of the profitability, which is also helping thanks to the growth.\\r\\n Looking at the volume question, I'm not entirely sure that I understood the analysis there because if you're looking at the growth in the second quarter, there is a fairly significant piece, which is coming from price increases. That's the majority. There is also some volume growth in Europe and in Ibero-America, if you're looking at the portfolio. But one area that where we are significantly lower today compared to a year ago is in the extra sales. And we've highlighted that in 2020 and 2021, we were operating significantly higher extra sales levels, and that was most pronounced in North America, when you're looking at the decline between Q2 '21 to Q2 '22. So that is also one important factor, but there we're also expecting that extra sales, and we're also starting to see some indications that the kind of the normal extra sales that we would typically have, which is more event related, et cetera. I mean that is also gradually starting to come back.\\r\\n So I think that those are really the key points in terms of volume. But just to reiterate that point is that there is positive volume growth also excluding price increases in Europe and Ibero-America in the second quarter. So that is also a driver behind the growth.\\r\\n Maybe on the ISC, Andreas, if you want to comment on that one.\"},\n",

So that is also contributing when you're looking at the margin improvements overall.\\r\\n On the items affecting comparability here, we gave a guidance of SEK 500 million to SEK 600 million in the previous quarter here. That was in the first quarter, of course. And then the further we're getting into the years, I mean the plan gets more and more clear. So then we can narrow down the forecast that we are seeing for the year. So you shouldn't see it as anything else than that. I mean we are now more confident that we will be around the SEK 550 million, SEK 600 million. So that's why we have made the window more narrow, and it's not any indications of changes for next year in any way.\"},\n",

Question #2, just to understand, so the Turkey official inflation has picked up again in Q2 relative to Q1.

So can you maybe just give us some figures on how much Turkey and Argentina contributed to organic growth in the quarter?\\r\\n And then finally, on Electronics.

If you're looking at the Turkey inflation, that and Argentina, together, we estimate around 2% impact on the organic sales growth in the quarter, those 2 combined. On Electronic Security, important here, I mean, we had -- and it was a tough start of the year. And that was a mix of a couple of different factors. One was COVID-related. And COVID related, it's sick leave among our people, technicians, for example, to be able to carry out installation projects. Also then COVID-related in the sense that we had a number of clients also then not allowing, due to restrictions, then access to their premises. But we started to see this improving in the second quarter. And we expect that to continuously improve as well as the situation is hopefully normalizing.\\r\\n But the other aspect of this is also the component shortages because that is still a major factor when you're looking at the Electronic Security projects and installation business because there has been a lot of instability and not reliable or availability in terms of supply of components. So that has really had an impact. But we did have positive growth in North America in the second quarter. So that was positive.

And then probably there is a little bit of mix benefit that was there. So just wondering how much this transformation programs are really contributing? Or if there is anything underlying, which is offsetting the impact. And I know you sort of answer the question of the Stanley deal later.

       "   'text': \"Good. Thank you. So on the margin in North America, the transformation program is clearly helping. And just to give some flavor in terms of how? I mean, we have upgraded from old systems, very many ways of working to now be significant -- I mean, completely digitized end-to-end in terms of how we're working with -- in everything that we do in terms of our employees in the frontline, like officers, all the way to invoicing our clients. The big benefit here is that we have significantly better transparency and visibility, significantly better decision-making support for our leaders that are managing the business at different levels all the way out to equivalent of a branch manager. So that is clearly helping. And there, I mean, we had some benefit in 2021 -- it's difficult to break out the exact impact, but that benefit is definitely increasing in 2022 and really contributing to the very strong margin delivery. Because we're delivering this also in an external environment, which is really challenging from a labor scarcity perspective.\\r\\n So I think that is to provide some context in terms of the North America transformation program. When I look at Europe, when you're looking at Ibero-America, I mean, there we are at a much earlier stage in terms of the programs. I mentioned a little bit related to Europe that, I mean, there, it's much more than just harmonizing the way of working and upgrading systems and tools. It's also then really helping us starting to shape and change the business mix towards more integrated solutions. There, we have done quite some investments and also starting to see some positive results. And that is also helping and driving more solutions momentum in Europe, and that by itself also has a positive impact on the margin. But like I said, that program, it's much, much early days and more of the work, but also more of the benefit to come over the next couple of years.\"},\n",

And just to remind, they were very significant in size, around $50 million, an aviation contract that we terminated last summer. And then the other contract was around $150 million that we terminated in December 2021. So that is the reason. The commercial momentum in North America is really strong. We are selling at a high pace with the good margins. So I would say the commercial activity is positive. And I would also just emphasize as well is that, I mean, we are 100% focused on protecting the value of our business. When we talk about active portfolio management, we are not seeking to just add a lot of volume and volume, and volume. It has to be good margins and good values that we can defend the quality and also continues to invest in the relationship and the delivery with our clients. And we are sticking to that. And I think that is also working because we are defending, thanks to very good quality but also continuously strengthening the offering. And here, obviously, in the technology space as well and with the transformation programs, it also enables us to operate in a stronger way. So that is some of the flavors. So no concern whatsoever from my perspective in terms of client retention. But we're obviously always humble in terms of how we are working with the clients, but we are very firm in terms of the profitability requirements for the reasons I mentioned.\\r\\n The airport business, yes, that is now more normalized. And that contract portfolio, as you remember, we did very significant portfolio management and cleanup activities to make sure that we had a healthy portfolio during the worst part of the pandemic. We are now seeing the results of that. So when we're looking from a profitability perspective, that profitability is now up and in line with the group average more or less. So it's a better quality portfolio when things are now hopefully normalizing as we're coming out of the worst year from the pandemic.\"},\n",

       "   'text': \"Just 2 for me. Just firstly, you talked a little bit about the extra sales declines from the numbers we saw during COVID. Is there any way you can try and help us by quantifying the step down you're still seeing versus last year? And also I'd be interested just to hear about where we are in those extra sales versus the pre-COVID levels, i.e., you sort of suggested it was kind of normalizing, but is that back at the kind of pre-COVID levels. Now that's the first question. And then secondly, just to follow back on the organic growth breakdown or kind of the building blocks. You said that 2% was hyperinflation. But maybe can you split the rest between what's normal price increases? Maybe what's kind of COVID recovery and then what's underlying volume growth in there as well. So that type of split would be really helpful.\"},\n",

       "   'text': \"Thank you, Allen. So I mean to be specific on the extra sales, it's roughly 3% less as the share of sales this year compared to last year. So a significant reduction. And that is most pronounced in North America in the second quarter because there we were also running with significantly higher COVID-related extra sales in Q2 last year. And that is -- I mean that business is no longer there. So I think that -- and to your second question, related to the extra sales, we are now at levels that are more kind of normal levels. Some quarters, it's going to be a little bit higher than where we are right now. If we're looking -- if the past is a good guidance related to the future. And we're also starting to see that, that more and more events are starting to come back, but it's also been a little bit tentative. If you're looking at the things that we are doing, AGMs, for example, we might be doing quite a lot of when it's AGM season, sports events, other industry type of events across different verticals, et cetera. And those, as you know, in some areas, they've kind of started to resume normal activity in some areas not. And those are obviously activities that we will typically also benefit our extra sales and even if on a temporary basis. But that's also the whole definition of the extra sales of the temp business, as we call it. So I hope that gives the flavor.

       " 'qa_colapsed': \"Yes. So thank you for the questions. On the margin, I mean, we are not breaking out the exact numbers behind. But when you're looking at this, I think, #1, we have had a consistent focus on ensuring that we are enhancing the profitability of the business. And this work is something that I think when you're looking at North America, even though we have organic sales growth, which is negative in the quarter, we are significantly expanding the margin. And that's a combination of a couple of different factors. One, of course, is portfolio management that we are carefully managing all contracts, and that is more important in this environment than ever before when there is labor scarcity. Another point is that the transformation program in North America is also operating -- I mean helping us to operate in a more efficient way. Another important driver is that we are driving very strong growth in terms of solutions and Electronic Security, which has a higher margin profile. And there, if you're looking at the overall group, 13% real sales growth compared to the same quarter last year. But then we've also undertaken quite a number of measures to make sure that we are running the business in a focused way, obviously, also have some positive impact from leverage in terms of the profitability, which is also helping thanks to the growth.\\r\\n Looking at the volume question, I'm not entirely sure that I understood the analysis there because if you're looking at the growth in the second quarter, there is a fairly significant piece, which is coming from price increases. That's the majority. There is also some volume growth in Europe and in Ibero-America, if you're looking at the portfolio. But one area that where we are significantly lower today compared to a year ago is in the extra sales. And we've highlighted that in 2020 and 2021, we were operating significantly higher extra sales levels, and that was most pronounced in North America, when you're looking at the decline between Q2 '21 to Q2 '22. So that is also one important factor, but there we're also expecting that extra sales, and we're also starting to see some indications that the kind of the normal extra sales that we would typically have, which is more event related, et cetera. I mean that is also gradually starting to come back.\\r\\n So I think that those are really the key points in terms of volume. But just to reiterate that point is that there is positive volume growth also excluding price increases in Europe and Ibero-America in the second quarter. So that is also a driver behind the growth.\\r\\n Maybe on the ISC, Andreas, if you want to comment on that one. I can just add there on the margin as well. I mean, we had really strong price/wage management, as we have said here as well. So that is also contributing when you're looking at the margin improvements overall.\\r\\n On the items affecting comparability here, we gave a guidance of SEK 500 million to SEK 600 million in the previous quarter here. That was in the first quarter, of course. And then the further we're getting into the years, I mean the plan gets more and more clear. So then we can narrow down the forecast that we are seeing for the year. So you shouldn't see it as anything else than that. I mean we are now more confident that we will be around the SEK 550 million, SEK 600 million. So that's why we have made the window more narrow, and it's not any indications of changes for next year in any way. Thank you, Sylvia. I will take questions #2 and 3, and then I hand back to Andreas on the provisions. If you're looking at the Turkey inflation, that and Argentina, together, we estimate around 2% impact on the organic sales growth in the quarter, those 2 combined. On Electronic Security, important here, I mean, we had -- and it was a tough start of the year. And that was a mix of a couple of different factors. One was COVID-related. And COVID related, it's sick leave among our people, technicians, for example, to be able to carry out installation projects. Also then COVID-related in the sense that we had a number of clients also then not allowing, due to restrictions, then access to their premises. But we started to see this improving in the second quarter. And we expect that to continuously improve as well as the situation is hopefully normalizing.\\r\\n But the other aspect of this is also the component shortages because that is still a major factor when you're looking at the Electronic Security projects and installation business because there has been a lot of instability and not reliable or availability in terms of supply of components. So that has really had an impact. But we did have positive growth in North America in the second quarter. So that was positive. And we also had positive growth in Europe in the second quarter and also the 2 major ones in terms of the ES business. Related to the provisions, basically, it's been a normal quarter here. So we have not touched any of the provisions that you mentioned here, Sylvia. And then, of course, you have ordinary course of business as well during the quarter. But related to the provisions we took in 2020, we have not touched those. No, I would say Sylvia it's been an ordinary quarter from that perspective. So there is nothing that is sticking out. Good. Thank you. So on the margin in North America, the transformation program is clearly helping. And just to give some flavor in terms of how? I mean, we have upgraded from old systems, very many ways of working to now be significant -- I mean, completely digitized end-to-end in terms of how we're working with -- in everything that we do in terms of our employees in the frontline, like officers, all the way to invoicing our clients. The big benefit here is that we have significantly better transparency and visibility, significantly better decision-making support for our leaders that are managing the business at different levels all the way out to equivalent of a branch manager. So that is clearly helping. And there, I mean, we had some benefit in 2021 -- it's difficult to break out the exact impact, but that benefit is definitely increasing in 2022 and really contributing to the very strong margin delivery. Because we're delivering this also in an external environment, which is really challenging from a labor scarcity perspective.\\r\\n So I think that is to provide some context in terms of the North America transformation program. When I look at Europe, when you're looking at Ibero-America, I mean, there we are at a much earlier stage in terms of the programs. I mentioned a little bit related to Europe that, I mean, there, it's much more than just harmonizing the way of working and upgrading systems and tools. It's also then really helping us starting to shape and change the business mix towards more integrated solutions. There, we have done quite some investments and also starting to see some positive results. And that is also helping and driving more solutions momentum in Europe, and that by itself also has a positive impact on the margin. But like I said, that program, it's much, much early days and more of the work, but also more of the benefit to come over the next couple of years. Related to the bridge facility there, I mean first of all, the bridges are normal commercial terms, I would say, without going into the details there, but they are also long in nature here. We have up to 24 months in terms of duration on these bridges as well. So from that position, we're sitting in a good position. Then you can also say, of course, that we signed these bridge facilities in a different market back in 2021 as well, which is not the negative thing here, given the developments in the debt market since. So I hope that gives you some flavor here related to the bridge. Because basically, we go out to our clients then and need to make sure that we get the right price increases in place, like Magnus said here, it's a very dynamic market where we have also been pushing out fairly high price increases. And of course, that is always a discussion together with our clients, where you also need to agree in the end on the final number. So that takes a bit longer time than in a normal year, where it's less numbers and it's also more straightforward. No. But that's not what I'm saying. It also takes longer time to negotiate as well, which is also then -- which is then also impacting the DSO. But the second point to highlight here as well, as I mentioned, if you're looking at the first half year is that we also had a very low DSO position by the end of last year, after a really strong cash print. So that is also impacting us here negatively as well. But then, of course, we need to make sure that we have a really solid also cash focus in the second quarter -- the second half year here as well. Thank you. Yes, your assumption is correct. That low retention rate is related to those low-margin contract terminations. And just to remind, they were very significant in size, around $50 million, an aviation contract that we terminated last summer. And then the other contract was around $150 million that we terminated in December 2021. So that is the reason. The commercial momentum in North America is really strong. We are selling at a high pace with the good margins. So I would say the commercial activity is positive. And I would also just emphasize as well is that, I mean, we are 100% focused on protecting the value of our business. When we talk about active portfolio management, we are not seeking to just add a lot of volume and volume, and volume. It has to be good margins and good values that we can defend the quality and also continues to invest in the relationship and the delivery with our clients. And we are sticking to that. And I think that is also working because we are defending, thanks to very good quality but also continuously strengthening the offering. And here, obviously, in the technology space as well and with the transformation programs, it also enables us to operate in a stronger way. So that is some of the flavors. So no concern whatsoever from my perspective in terms of client retention. But we're obviously always humble in terms of how we are working with the clients, but we are very firm in terms of the profitability requirements for the reasons I mentioned.\\r\\n The airport business, yes, that is now more normalized. And that contract portfolio, as you remember, we did very significant portfolio management and cleanup activities to make sure that we had a healthy portfolio during the worst part of the pandemic. We are now seeing the results of that. So when we're looking from a profitability perspective, that profitability is now up and in line with the group average more or less. So it's a better quality portfolio when things are now hopefully normalizing as we're coming out of the worst year from the pandemic. So when you're looking at that, I mean, we feel good about the ambition there and our ability to be able to deliver on the margin improvement. We are obviously significantly accelerating the transformation and realization of the strategy with the acquisition of Stanley Security. There are 9 markets in Europe, where we are building a real position of strength either by combining Electronic Security, existing that we have or building, and that will definitely also help the overall case. So no concerns in terms of temporary -- I mean, I think, it's just a prudent thing to do that we now have significant integration and creation effort ahead of us in terms of really integrating Stanley over the next 3, 6, 12 months, but we will also have a significantly stronger offering to the clients and more future-proof position, which I think is important as well because technology is just becoming more and more important and even more so when you're looking at the challenges that we're seeing in the labor market, just finding people. So yes, I hope that answers your question. Thank you, Allen. So I mean to be specific on the extra sales, it's roughly 3% less as the share of sales this year compared to last year. So a significant reduction. And that is most pronounced in North America in the second quarter because there we were also running with significantly higher COVID-related extra sales in Q2 last year. And that is -- I mean that business is no longer there. So I think that -- and to your second question, related to the extra sales, we are now at levels that are more kind of normal levels. Some quarters, it's going to be a little bit higher than where we are right now. If we're looking -- if the past is a good guidance related to the future. And we're also starting to see that, that more and more events are starting to come back, but it's also been a little bit tentative. If you're looking at the things that we are doing, AGMs, for example, we might be doing quite a lot of when it's AGM season, sports events, other industry type of events across different verticals, et cetera. And those, as you know, in some areas, they've kind of started to resume normal activity in some areas not. And those are obviously activities that we will typically also benefit our extra sales and even if on a temporary basis. But that's also the whole definition of the extra sales of the temp business, as we call it. So I hope that gives the flavor. But on a year-on-year basis, around 3% less as a percentage of sales compared to last year's same period. I can add on there, related to the extra sales. I mean, in normal years, we normally are around 13% to 15% extra sales. And now, we are at 13%. So I would say we are sort of at the bottom of the normal range here as well -- as Magnus is saying here, there are AGMs and other type of temporary business that starts to increase going forward as well. So it might be that we have an opportunity here going forward to be a bit higher than we were in Q2. When it comes to then the organic sales growth overall, I mean looking at this, we would say, overall, around 4%, a bit less than that, we would estimate to be price increases and -- sorry, between 4% and 5%, I should say. We estimate to be around price increases and the remaining we see as volume here. And that is then derived from the aviation business recovery, the portfolio growth that we've seen in Europe and Iberia America, but also the strong Electronic Security and Solutions here as well. Thank you, Karl-Johan.

But you're right, we have these 2 components to handle as well in the second half year. So... At what point -- at what point in time are you referring to now? But I think exactly -- this will be, of course, one component of interest, and this is exactly something we will come back to here in August, but we will give you a full brief around that instead of commenting around that individually here now. Yes. Thank you. So on Ibero-America, it is true what you are reflecting on here. I mean, we are performing, I would say, driving improvements at a faster pace than what we would have anticipated. So that obviously then is yes. That's the simple reality. But we will also, when we are talking on the 24th, also provide new financial targets, I think it's prudent as well that we then come back and comment. And I promise to come back to that question in some more detail also in that update.\\r\\n And just on the second question, I mean the strategic logic is strong here. We feel very good, like I said, about the value creation case. We will provide a lot more detail on the 24th. But Andreas, maybe you have just one brief comment here before we continue. Yes. You have -- in the report here, you have an estimate related to the amortization of acquisition intangibles. And this is preliminary, of course. But the total amount allocated here is around USD 500 million, mainly then related to customer portfolio, which will be amortized over 15 years. So you will approximately have an amortization charge per year of USD 35 million, still being preliminary, but the information is there in Note 2 as well. I can also just come back to Sylvia here who had a question around the provision line in itself. And I think I gave the overall answer, and that still stands. But I just want to make it clear there that the bad debt provisions that we took in 2020 are not on the line provisions here. That is a reduction of account receivables. So there is no connection there. And then the movement on the provision line is related to a reduction in our pension liabilities, given the increased interest rate environment here as well. And that is something that goes through equity and not the income statement, to be clear there as well. Good. So unless there are any further questions, thank you, everyone, for your engagement. And as we said before, we're looking forward to seeing you for the event on the 24th of August. And in the meantime, everyone in the Northern Hemisphere, wishing then good continued hopefully summer time. Thank you.\",\n",

We continue to execute on our strategy, and this is generating results. When looking at the quarter, we increased the business momentum, continued margin improvement and profit growth. The organic sales growth increased to 6% with strong growth in Europe and Ibero-America. We had negative growth as expected in North America, but are now turning the corner and expecting to return to positive growth in the third quarter. The operating margin increased to 5.8%, and we're now almost 1% higher margin when comparing with the pre-COVID years.\\r\\n North America and Ibero-America are the main contributors and the margin in Europe was stable when comparing to the same period last year. But the external environment continues to be challenging in terms of labor scarcity and inflation, but we are managing well and have a positive price/wage balance year-to-date. And given the circumstances, we will continue to work with dynamic price increases to balance wage increases and importantly, to safeguard the quality of our delivery to our clients.\\r\\n And as is visible in the numbers, a strong focus on improving profitability is now starting to generate real results. We had 13% real sales growth in solutions and Electronic Security, which is a very strong performance with good growth across all segments. And our offering is strong, and we are winning more business at improved margins versus last year. And this, in combination with portfolio management and the impacts from the transformation programs is resulting in higher profitability.\\r\\n And last but not least, we are very proud that Securitas, as the first major security services company, has committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative. Sustainability has always been a focus here at Securitas, but this is further proof of our commitment to continue to deliver sustainable security and safety services and leading the industry also in this important aspect.\\r\\n And as you have hopefully noticed, we were also very glad to announce last week that we have now closed the Stanley Security. And the joint integration preparation work has been solid, and we are very happy and ready to join forces now with the Stanley Security team. And we have planned for an investor update on August 24 to share more about the strategy of the group with new financial targets, and I hope that you are able to join us virtually for that session.\\r\\n So with that, let us now turn in the different business segments. And starting with North America, where, as expected, we did have negative organic growth in the quarter due to the termination of announced low-margin contracts, but also a very significant reduction in COVID-related extra sales compared with the same period last year. But we have good underlying momentum in the North American business. New sales are strong in the Guarding business, and we're managing price increases successfully and in a dynamic manner.\\r\\n The Electronic Security installation business improved in Q2 after a challenging start to the year, but we're still facing challenges related to component shortage and labor shortage. But it is important to note that we had positive organic sales growth, strong order intake and record level backlog in the quarter.\\r\\n And our Pinkerton risk management business is also growing at a healthy pace and contributing. So based on this underlying strength, we are expecting to return to positive organic sales growth in the third quarter.\\r\\n And looking then at the profitability, the margin expansion in North America continues with improvements supported by all business units. The operating margin of 7.4% is the highest ever achieved in North America. And there are a number of reasons behind this. And starting with the Guarding business, there are a few key drivers behind the positive development. The business transformation program that we finished last year, active portfolio management and an increase in solution sales are all contributing to the positive development.\\r\\n Looking at Electronic Security, we had an improved business mix and also solid execution by our team, and that also contributed to the results. The development of our Pinkerton business was also solid, and we also had a positive contribution from the Critical Infrastructure Services business.\\r\\n So when you're looking at North America, we have undertaken significant modernization and digitization on North America business with significant investments over the last couple of years. And our team's execution of the strategy is now generating results with structurally higher margins.\\r\\n So with that, let us then shift the focus to Europe, where we had very strong growth of 9% in the quarter. And there are a few factors contributing to the growth. First, we had positive portfolio development. So that means the strong commercial momentum is resulting in positive portfolio growth also when excluding price increases. Secondly, the aviation business is returning to more normalized levels of demand. This also contributed. And third, we are increasing prices at significantly higher rates than normal to balance wage increases.\\r\\n But I'm also very glad to report that we had solid growth in sales of Solutions and Electronic Security in Europe in the quarter, and that also had a real positive impact on the sales growth.\\r\\n And looking at the profitability, the margin of 5.5% was stable versus the same quarter last year despite the challenges related to sickness and labor shortages. At active portfolio management as well as previously acquired Electronic Security businesses contributed positively to the margin.\\r\\n Sickness rates and the cost related to labor shortages improved somewhat versus the first quarter but are still impacting the bottom line in a negative way. And as was the case in the first quarter, these challenges are more pronounced in a few markets in Europe and in the rest of the countries, we are managing quite well.\\r\\n Cost measures and some leverage from the strong growth also helped the margin. So when looking ahead, we expect the labor market in Europe to remain challenging, and we continue to work in a more dynamic manner to balance wage increases with price increases. And apart from that, we're also actively promoting connected technology and integrated solutions to our clients as a means to improve the security equation and managing total cost for our clients.\\r\\n And moving then to Ibero-America, where we have continued very positive development in terms of top line growth but also profitability. And in Spain, we had organic sales growth of 10% in the quarter with a strong development across the business. Latin America improved compared to last year, but price increases in Argentina were the primary driver from a Latin American perspective, contribution to the growth. And the good momentum with sales of Security Solutions and Electronic Security continued. These sales are now representing 30% of total sales.\\r\\n But we also have very strong development in terms of profitability. Our Ibero-America team are executing on the strategy, create a sharper and more profitable business, and this is paying off. The operating margin is 40 to 50 basis points higher versus the same period last year and more than 1% higher when comparing with the pre-COVID periods. And the improvement is driven by Spain, Portugal, but we also had positive contribution from most countries in Latin America that are performing at a higher level.\\r\\n So all in all, a strong quarter, strong continued development of the overall business. And I think with that, I hand over to Andreas for some more details regarding the financials.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [2]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Magnus, and good afternoon, everyone. We start, as always, with our income statement here. The second quarter was as Magnus mentioned, a strong quarter with solid growth and an improving operating margin at 5.8%.\\r\\n The operating margin is not only strong when comparing to last year, but also substantially higher than the pre-COVID Q2 levels at around 5%, confirming that our execution of the strategy is on the right way. The margin development was supported by strong double-digit growth in the high-margin solutions and Electronic Security business. And the teams have done a really good job with the price/wage balance, which so far in the year are contributing to the margin.\\r\\n I should highlight that the operating result in the second quarter did not include any material government grants related to COVID-19 and the number of people on temporary unemployment was on very low levels. One accounting update, here in the second quarter, is that Turkey, as from April 1, is considered hyperinflationary for the purpose of the reporting under IAS 29 hyperinflation. As you know, we have also applied IAS 29 for our operations in Argentina since Q3 2018. It is a straightforward standard from the perspective that it targets to give better insight into the effect from high inflation, both related to the balance sheet and the income statement. The implementation of this standard is, however, fairly technical in nature. And to keep it simple here related to Turkey, the impact on Securitas is not material, as you can also see on Page 9 in the report under the table for security services Europe. The impact on the balance sheet related to Turkey is an increase in capital employed of SEK 463 million and the same amount increased in equity. That relates to the revaluation that we then do on the opening balance sheet on April 1. Then during the quarter, we have reevaluated the income statement and the balance sheet as well. The conclusion of that is that there is almost no effect on sales nor operating results. The most significant impact is within the financial items line with a positive effect of SEK 17 million. We have continued to treat the effects from the standard similar to currency impact. This means that none of our key ratios, such as organic growth or real change are impacted from bringing Turkey in. You'll find more details around this in Note 8 of the report.\\r\\n If we then have a look below the operating result. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was SEK 61 million in the quarter, basically the same number as in the first quarter and nothing major to report here.\\r\\n Looking at the acquisition-related costs, they were again limited in the quarter as our acquisition activity is reduced after the announcement of the Stanley transaction. We have posted acquisitions to focus on the Stanley integration and deleveraging of our balance sheet position. There may be 1 or 2 smaller exceptions to this, but there will be nothing major in the coming quarters. So we expect the acquisition-related costs to be lower than 2021 for the full year. Remember here that the acquisition costs related to Stanley is reported under items affecting comparability.\\r\\n Going then to exactly that, items affecting comparability. Here, we had SEK 226 million of cost in the quarter, which is approximately SEK 30 million less than last year. The reduction is a consequence of us closing down 3 programs at the end of 2021. Of the SEK 226 million, SEK 169 million was related to the ongoing European and Ibero-America transformation programs and the residual SEK 57 million was paid transaction costs related to the Stanley acquisition. And I will come back with some more information here on the next page.\\r\\n If we then have a look at the financial net. Here, we had a SEK 30 million reduction in cost in the quarter. The underlying interest cost increased somewhat due to the increased interest rates that we are seeing, but we had some smaller positive FX impacts and together with around SEK 30 million positive impact from IAS-29. That explains the difference here.\\r\\n As I mentioned earlier, SEK 17 million is related to Turkey and the residual is related to Argentina, referencing then the SEK 30 million IAS-29 impact. Given the high inflation and increased interest rate in the market, we are expecting to see an increased financial net for the full year 2022, when we compare to 2021, also then excluding the impacts of the hyperinflation. This is, of course, also excluding the finance costs related to Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n Looking at the tax. The tax rate forecast for the full year remains at 27.0%, and there are basically no major news in this forecast.\\r\\n On the next slide, we have some additional information related then to the programs we are running under items affecting comparability. Important here is that we closed down 3 programs at the end of last year, which is reducing the complexity here. In North America, the team is continuing to execute on realizing the benefits from the North America transformation program that we implemented last year. We see positive margin impacts from the program in 2022, and there is further potential here going forward. The European and Ibero-America transformation programs are continuing the execution. The programs are on track, and we will, over the coming quarters, start to go live in phases with new digital platforms in several countries. We have an important year ahead of us in terms of execution here.\\r\\n The items affecting comparability related to these programs were SEK 169 million in the second quarter, and our estimate for the full year is between SEK 550 million and SEK 600 million. And this then also includes the impact from the cloud computing accounting regulations implemented and communicated in Q4.\\r\\n We have, as I mentioned, also occurred SEK 57 million of costs related to the Stanley acquisition in the quarter. Totally, since the announcement, we have spent SEK 132 million of the approximately SEK 1.4 billion transaction integration and restructuring costs related to the acquisition. The plan is that the majority of these costs will be expensed over 2022 and 2023.\\r\\n Moving then to the next page, where we have an overview of the FX impact on the income statement. There were major impacts from FX in the quarter, mainly related to the U.S. dollar that appreciated 19% to the Swedish krona compared to last year. The total FX impact on sales was 9% in the second quarter, mainly then driven by the U.S. dollar, while the euro appreciated 5%.\\r\\n Looking at our operating result, the FX impact was a bit higher at 12%, mainly due to the higher profitability levels in our North American business and the currency impact increased further when looking at EPS. The EPS real change before items affecting comparability was solid at 10% in the quarter and 11% for the first 6 months with good cost leverage on the items below operating result. Including the items affecting comparability, the real change was even a bit stronger coming from the reduced IC spend this year.\\r\\n We then move to cash flow. The cash flow from operating activities was SEK 927 million or 53% of the operating result in the second quarter, a good improvement compared to the first quarter and a solid Q2 outcome, taking into consideration the current high growth that we are seeing in the business. If we look into the larger movements here in the quarter, we saw an increase in CapEx of almost SEK 190 million. We saw an increase in our investments into our solution contracts, which confirms the positive momentum we have in the high-margin solutions business. A major part of the increase was also related to the existing transformation programs, which are progressing according to plan.\\r\\n The CapEx to sales was 2.8% in the quarter, and we continue to expect to come in below 3% for the year. The account receivables was minus SEK 873 million. And here, we see the impact from the strong growth that we are seeing in the business. Growth consumes cash for us as we normally are paying our employees ahead of getting paid from our clients. We also see a slight impact on the DSO from the price increase measures that we have successfully executed, where it takes a bit of time to conclude with the clients on these negotiations and then get back to normal again.\\r\\n We have a strong focus and attention in the divisions and in the countries to ensure we keep this on track in the second half year. Looking then at the free cash flow in Q2, which ended up at almost SEK 500 million. This is an improvement both in absolute and percentage terms compared to last year and was supported by reduced tax payments in the U.S. related to preliminary federal tax. Last year in Q2, we made larger true-up payments related to 2020, and this was now back to normal levels this year, having a positive impact when comparing the quarters. So we are reasonably satisfied with the second quarter cash flow. We are still behind for the first half year after the weaker Q1, where the main reasons was related to account receivables, where we had flat growth and a low DSO position at the end of last year, which impacted the first quarter.\\r\\n Last year, we also had positive payroll timing impacts in both the U.S. and The Netherlands of approximately SEK 600 million benefit in Q1. These payroll time and differences were neutral on a full-year basis 2021. Going forward, we should also remember that we will still pay the final SEK 600 million of corona-related time and relief measures that we benefited from in 2020 in North America, and this we will pay in Q4 this year.\\r\\n So we continue to have high focus on cash flow given the current macroeconomical environment and the Stanley transaction. Combined with the normal seasonality of a stronger second half year cash flow, we are working here to make sure we have a solid 2022 outcome here.\\r\\n We then go to the slide related to net debt. Our net debt increased with approximately SEK 3.9 billion in the first 6 months compared to the beginning of the year. The main reason for the increase is the regular dividend of SEK 1.6 billion paid in the second quarter. IAC related payments of close to SEK 500 million and a material FX translation impact of almost SEK 1.3 billion. Combining this with a negative free cash flow for the first half year and an increase in lease liabilities, mainly related to new office leases, the net debt ended up at SEK 18.4 million. Our net debt-to-EBITDA came in at 2.2%. This is flat compared to June last year, but with a 0.2% increase compared to Q1, mainly related to the regular dividend payment. As you know, our financial target is 2.5%, and we continue to be below this target preparing ahead of the Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n Moving on to the next slide and looking at our financial position and debt maturity short. As you know, we have a solid financing in place today. None of our facilities have any financial covenants and the liquidity position is strong. In April, we extended our EUR 938 million RCF for another year into 2027. And now in July, we added one more bank into the facility, increasing the number of banks to 11, and the total facility amount is then a bit more than EUR 1 billion, preparing here, of course, to become a larger group after the Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n As you also know since before, we have a bridge facility in place related to the USD 3.2 billion Stanley transaction, and we used this facility now on July 22 when paying the purchase price at closing. The bridge facility will be refinanced with a mix of debt and equity, where the rights issue will be approximately USD 950 million. We will launch the rights issue now in September, and there will be further details coming around this in the near-term future. We will thereafter also focus on the debt takeout where the exact timing is still to be decided.\\r\\n Looking at our rating. Here, we have been on credit watch by Standard &amp; Poor as a consequence of the announced Stanley transaction. As the transaction closed now, S&amp;P confirmed early this week that our update grading now is BBB minus with stable outlook, which was also in line with our expectations. So we reiterate our commitment to remain investment grade here, and we will focus on deleveraging our balance sheet going forward.\\r\\n And with that, I now hand back to Magnus.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [3]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Many thanks, Andreas. I would like to share just a few updates related to our transformation programs and the Stanley acquisition before we open up for the Q&amp;A. And starting with the transformation programs, we concluded the North American global IT programs at the end of 2021. And as previously mentioned, the investments made are now starting to generate returns, thanks to modern platforms and tools that enable us to optimize the business like never before. And we're also executing according to plan with the programs in Europe and Ibero-America. The European program is comprehensive. And if you're looking at the last 12 months, we have strengthened the solutions organization to drive improvement in the business mix. And during the coming 6 to 12 months, we're starting to transition to new systems and applications in some of the key markets.\\r\\n And all this work is fundamentally important to create a modern, digitally capable and more efficient Securitas. And this work also gives us a stronger foundation to leverage modern systems and applications when we are integrating the Stanley Security businesses.\\r\\n And a few words about Stanley. So by joining forces, we are building the foundation to be the leading intelligent security solutions partner. We become the most attractive choice for clients with a clearly differentiated offering and with world-leading technology and expertise. And technology is becoming increasingly important for our clients. And together with Stanley, we're shifting the profile of Securitas in terms of the offering to our clients and value creation. This is also immediately margin accretive. Over 50% of the contribution to operating results will come from higher value and higher growth solutions and Electronic Security.\\r\\n And we have received a tremendous response from our clients regarding the opportunities that this combination will bring. And together with Stanley, we are in a solid position to create an outstanding team, which is perfectly placed to win in the security services industry.\\r\\n So to conclude this, before we open up the Q&amp;A, we are executing on our strategy, and this is generating results. We increased the margin to 5.8% in the quarter and recorded 11% EPS growth in the first half of the year. And this is despite the turbulent external environment, and I am very proud of our team, which is delivering results today and at the same time, building the new Securitas. And that is the Securitas which is modern, digitized and innovative security solutions company.\\r\\n But before we open up to Q&amp;A, related to the Stanley acquisition, I understand that there is a lot of interest and questions. And for this reason, I would like to mention once again that we have arranged an Investor Update on August 24. And in that session, we will share an update of the strategy, a lot more detail related to the importance of the Stanley Security acquisition. And like I mentioned before, updated financial targets for the group.\\r\\n And by the 24th of August, we have also owned the business for a little bit more than a month. And my request today is that we then take all the Stanley-related questions in that session.\\r\\n So with that, happy to open up the Q&amp;A.\\r\\n================================================================================\\r\\nQuestions and Answers\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [1]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The first question comes from Kate Somerville at UBS.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Katherine Somerville,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Analyst   [2]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I have 3, if I may. The first question is on the margin. I have estimated about -- near about 6 basis points of your margin improvement is from mix. And can you help us understand how much the remaining 14 basis points comes from the positive price/wage balance, the lost contracts and also your efficiency savings? That would be very helpful. My second question is on volumes. It seems as if volumes have slowed from being flat in Q1 to negative 3% in Q2. If you could give us any sort of color on what's driven that? And then finally, it seems that you've reduced the range for your items affecting comparability to SEK 550 million to SEK 600 million from -- from SEK 500 million to SEK 600 million to SEK 550 million to SEK 600 million. And should we expect any changes to the 2023 expectations?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [3]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. So thank you for the questions. On the margin, I mean, we are not breaking out the exact numbers behind. But when you're looking at this, I think, #1, we have had a consistent focus on ensuring that we are enhancing the profitability of the business. And this work is something that I think when you're looking at North America, even though we have organic sales growth, which is negative in the quarter, we are significantly expanding the margin. And that's a combination of a couple of different factors. One, of course, is portfolio management that we are carefully managing all contracts, and that is more important in this environment than ever before when there is labor scarcity. Another point is that the transformation program in North America is also operating -- I mean helping us to operate in a more efficient way. Another important driver is that we are driving very strong growth in terms of solutions and Electronic Security, which has a higher margin profile. And there, if you're looking at the overall group, 13% real sales growth compared to the same quarter last year. But then we've also undertaken quite a number of measures to make sure that we are running the business in a focused way, obviously, also have some positive impact from leverage in terms of the profitability, which is also helping thanks to the growth.\\r\\n Looking at the volume question, I'm not entirely sure that I understood the analysis there because if you're looking at the growth in the second quarter, there is a fairly significant piece, which is coming from price increases. That's the majority. There is also some volume growth in Europe and in Ibero-America, if you're looking at the portfolio. But one area that where we are significantly lower today compared to a year ago is in the extra sales. And we've highlighted that in 2020 and 2021, we were operating significantly higher extra sales levels, and that was most pronounced in North America, when you're looking at the decline between Q2 '21 to Q2 '22. So that is also one important factor, but there we're also expecting that extra sales, and we're also starting to see some indications that the kind of the normal extra sales that we would typically have, which is more event related, et cetera. I mean that is also gradually starting to come back.\\r\\n So I think that those are really the key points in terms of volume. But just to reiterate that point is that there is positive volume growth also excluding price increases in Europe and Ibero-America in the second quarter. So that is also a driver behind the growth.\\r\\n Maybe on the ISC, Andreas, if you want to comment on that one.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [4]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I can just add there on the margin as well. I mean, we had really strong price/wage management, as we have said here as well. So that is also contributing when you're looking at the margin improvements overall.\\r\\n On the items affecting comparability here, we gave a guidance of SEK 500 million to SEK 600 million in the previous quarter here. That was in the first quarter, of course. And then the further we're getting into the years, I mean the plan gets more and more clear. So then we can narrow down the forecast that we are seeing for the year. So you shouldn't see it as anything else than that. I mean we are now more confident that we will be around the SEK 550 million, SEK 600 million. So that's why we have made the window more narrow, and it's not any indications of changes for next year in any way.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [5]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Sylvia Barker at JPMorgan.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Sylvia Pavlova Barker,  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst   [6]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Question #1, I've got 3, please, if I may. Question #1, on provisions. I can see that they've reduced by about SEK 200 million on the balance sheet. And I know that you were still sitting on the SEK 530 million of COVID provisions at the end of Q1. So could you maybe just update us if anything has been released during the quarter? Question #2, just to understand, so the Turkey official inflation has picked up again in Q2 relative to Q1. So I'm making it out as being perhaps of the 300 basis points of your organic growth, but that seems a bit high. So can you maybe just give us some figures on how much Turkey and Argentina contributed to organic growth in the quarter?\\r\\n And then finally, on Electronics. So obviously, a bit difficult, but it seems like the organic overall for Electronic is still kind of neutral to maybe slightly negative if I look at the overall SS and ES sales in the quarter, excluding FX and acquisitions, could you maybe just comment on that figure and what you might see going forward?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [7]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Sylvia. I will take questions #2 and 3, and then I hand back to Andreas on the provisions. If you're looking at the Turkey inflation, that and Argentina, together, we estimate around 2% impact on the organic sales growth in the quarter, those 2 combined. On Electronic Security, important here, I mean, we had -- and it was a tough start of the year. And that was a mix of a couple of different factors. One was COVID-related. And COVID related, it's sick leave among our people, technicians, for example, to be able to carry out installation projects. Also then COVID-related in the sense that we had a number of clients also then not allowing, due to restrictions, then access to their premises. But we started to see this improving in the second quarter. And we expect that to continuously improve as well as the situation is hopefully normalizing.\\r\\n But the other aspect of this is also the component shortages because that is still a major factor when you're looking at the Electronic Security projects and installation business because there has been a lot of instability and not reliable or availability in terms of supply of components. So that has really had an impact. But we did have positive growth in North America in the second quarter. So that was positive. And we also had positive growth in Europe in the second quarter and also the 2 major ones in terms of the ES business.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [8]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Related to the provisions, basically, it's been a normal quarter here. So we have not touched any of the provisions that you mentioned here, Sylvia. And then, of course, you have ordinary course of business as well during the quarter. But related to the provisions we took in 2020, we have not touched those.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Sylvia Pavlova Barker,  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst   [9]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n And sorry, just in terms of other ones, then just the -- balance sheet reduction doesn't always match against what's happening in the P&amp;L. But is there anything else in any of the regions that's worth picking out or?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [10]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n No, I would say Sylvia it's been an ordinary quarter from that perspective. So there is nothing that is sticking out.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [11]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Anvesh Agrawal at Morgan Stanley.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Anvesh Agrawal,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst   [12]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I got 2 questions. First, just on the margin point further. I was just trying to understand how much really the transformation programs are contributing. So if you -- I mean, I calculated like half of the margin improvement or 10 basis points is coming from just from FX given the tailwinds you had? And then probably there is a little bit of mix benefit that was there. So just wondering how much this transformation programs are really contributing? Or if there is anything underlying, which is offsetting the impact. And I know you sort of answer the question of the Stanley deal later. But just on the bridge refinancing facility, I wanted to check whether it's on a fixed or a floating rate? And is there any upside risk to that exceptional item given how the interest rates have fared since you announced the deal, obviously?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [13]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Good. Thank you. So on the margin in North America, the transformation program is clearly helping. And just to give some flavor in terms of how? I mean, we have upgraded from old systems, very many ways of working to now be significant -- I mean, completely digitized end-to-end in terms of how we're working with -- in everything that we do in terms of our employees in the frontline, like officers, all the way to invoicing our clients. The big benefit here is that we have significantly better transparency and visibility, significantly better decision-making support for our leaders that are managing the business at different levels all the way out to equivalent of a branch manager. So that is clearly helping. And there, I mean, we had some benefit in 2021 -- it's difficult to break out the exact impact, but that benefit is definitely increasing in 2022 and really contributing to the very strong margin delivery. Because we're delivering this also in an external environment, which is really challenging from a labor scarcity perspective.\\r\\n So I think that is to provide some context in terms of the North America transformation program. When I look at Europe, when you're looking at Ibero-America, I mean, there we are at a much earlier stage in terms of the programs. I mentioned a little bit related to Europe that, I mean, there, it's much more than just harmonizing the way of working and upgrading systems and tools. It's also then really helping us starting to shape and change the business mix towards more integrated solutions. There, we have done quite some investments and also starting to see some positive results. And that is also helping and driving more solutions momentum in Europe, and that by itself also has a positive impact on the margin. But like I said, that program, it's much, much early days and more of the work, but also more of the benefit to come over the next couple of years.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [14]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Related to the bridge facility there, I mean first of all, the bridges are normal commercial terms, I would say, without going into the details there, but they are also long in nature here. We have up to 24 months in terms of duration on these bridges as well. So from that position, we're sitting in a good position. Then you can also say, of course, that we signed these bridge facilities in a different market back in 2021 as well, which is not the negative thing here, given the developments in the debt market since. So I hope that gives you some flavor here related to the bridge.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Anvesh Agrawal,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst   [15]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. I am sorry, maybe if I can just ask one, but just going back to -- I mean, we've seen the sort of pick up in the DSO and you said that it's essentially because of price rises and that takes time but once those are settled with the customer. I'm not sure I quite understood that. Like why would the price increase impact the DSOs?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [16]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Because basically, we go out to our clients then and need to make sure that we get the right price increases in place, like Magnus said here, it's a very dynamic market where we have also been pushing out fairly high price increases. And of course, that is always a discussion together with our clients, where you also need to agree in the end on the final number. So that takes a bit longer time than in a normal year, where it's less numbers and it's also more straightforward.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Anvesh Agrawal,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst   [17]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. I mean I can take it offline, but like it seems like you recognize revenue anyways and then sort of go for the final settlement with the clients.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [18]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n No. But that's not what I'm saying. It also takes longer time to negotiate as well, which is also then -- which is then also impacting the DSO. But the second point to highlight here as well, as I mentioned, if you're looking at the first half year is that we also had a very low DSO position by the end of last year, after a really strong cash print. So that is also impacting us here negatively as well. But then, of course, we need to make sure that we have a really solid also cash focus in the second quarter -- the second half year here as well.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [19]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Viktor Lindeberg, Carnegie.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Viktor Lindeberg,  Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Research Analyst   [20]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Actually, some were answered now, but following up on client retention. And excuse me if I missed this in the beginning, but you mentioned in North America, client retention rate goes from 90% to 85%. Is this purely related to the contracts that you have exited now in the past year? Or is there -- could you sort of provide us with an underlying number here? That's my first. Second question is then on the airport contract portfolio that you had during the pandemic strategic review of -- and now I guess Q2 has been more or less the first quarter with normalized operating conditions and volumes, give or take. So any conclusions you can share on this? Or how we should think about the airport contribution to the group as such?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [21]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you. Yes, your assumption is correct. That low retention rate is related to those low-margin contract terminations. And just to remind, they were very significant in size, around $50 million, an aviation contract that we terminated last summer. And then the other contract was around $150 million that we terminated in December 2021. So that is the reason. The commercial momentum in North America is really strong. We are selling at a high pace with the good margins. So I would say the commercial activity is positive. And I would also just emphasize as well is that, I mean, we are 100% focused on protecting the value of our business. When we talk about active portfolio management, we are not seeking to just add a lot of volume and volume, and volume. It has to be good margins and good values that we can defend the quality and also continues to invest in the relationship and the delivery with our clients. And we are sticking to that. And I think that is also working because we are defending, thanks to very good quality but also continuously strengthening the offering. And here, obviously, in the technology space as well and with the transformation programs, it also enables us to operate in a stronger way. So that is some of the flavors. So no concern whatsoever from my perspective in terms of client retention. But we're obviously always humble in terms of how we are working with the clients, but we are very firm in terms of the profitability requirements for the reasons I mentioned.\\r\\n The airport business, yes, that is now more normalized. And that contract portfolio, as you remember, we did very significant portfolio management and cleanup activities to make sure that we had a healthy portfolio during the worst part of the pandemic. We are now seeing the results of that. So when we're looking from a profitability perspective, that profitability is now up and in line with the group average more or less. So it's a better quality portfolio when things are now hopefully normalizing as we're coming out of the worst year from the pandemic.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Viktor Lindeberg,  Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Research Analyst   [22]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n And maybe final from my side. Your slide at the very end, Magnus, on the transformation programs and the benefits you expect in Europe by 2024. I understand part of the margin accretion is going to come from M&amp;A. And now, we have the Stanley acquisition, obviously, but you also now say you put M&amp;A on hold for the time being, given focus and obviously leverage. But how should we read that in that context, given that M&amp;A was expected to contribute now that maybe not will happen as much. Obviously, Stanley is accretive in itself, but just trying to figure out the bits and pieces here on that.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [23]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n So when you're looking at that, I mean, we feel good about the ambition there and our ability to be able to deliver on the margin improvement. We are obviously significantly accelerating the transformation and realization of the strategy with the acquisition of Stanley Security. There are 9 markets in Europe, where we are building a real position of strength either by combining Electronic Security, existing that we have or building, and that will definitely also help the overall case. So no concerns in terms of temporary -- I mean, I think, it's just a prudent thing to do that we now have significant integration and creation effort ahead of us in terms of really integrating Stanley over the next 3, 6, 12 months, but we will also have a significantly stronger offering to the clients and more future-proof position, which I think is important as well because technology is just becoming more and more important and even more so when you're looking at the challenges that we're seeing in the labor market, just finding people. So yes, I hope that answers your question.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [24]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Allen Wells at Jefferies.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Allen David Wells,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst   [25]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Just 2 for me. Just firstly, you talked a little bit about the extra sales declines from the numbers we saw during COVID. Is there any way you can try and help us by quantifying the step down you're still seeing versus last year? And also I'd be interested just to hear about where we are in those extra sales versus the pre-COVID levels, i.e., you sort of suggested it was kind of normalizing, but is that back at the kind of pre-COVID levels. Now that's the first question. And then secondly, just to follow back on the organic growth breakdown or kind of the building blocks. You said that 2% was hyperinflation. But maybe can you split the rest between what's normal price increases? Maybe what's kind of COVID recovery and then what's underlying volume growth in there as well. So that type of split would be really helpful.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [26]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Allen. So I mean to be specific on the extra sales, it's roughly 3% less as the share of sales this year compared to last year. So a significant reduction. And that is most pronounced in North America in the second quarter because there we were also running with significantly higher COVID-related extra sales in Q2 last year. And that is -- I mean that business is no longer there. So I think that -- and to your second question, related to the extra sales, we are now at levels that are more kind of normal levels. Some quarters, it's going to be a little bit higher than where we are right now. If we're looking -- if the past is a good guidance related to the future. And we're also starting to see that, that more and more events are starting to come back, but it's also been a little bit tentative. If you're looking at the things that we are doing, AGMs, for example, we might be doing quite a lot of when it's AGM season, sports events, other industry type of events across different verticals, et cetera. And those, as you know, in some areas, they've kind of started to resume normal activity in some areas not. And those are obviously activities that we will typically also benefit our extra sales and even if on a temporary basis. But that's also the whole definition of the extra sales of the temp business, as we call it. So I hope that gives the flavor. But on a year-on-year basis, around 3% less as a percentage of sales compared to last year's same period.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [27]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I can add on there, related to the extra sales. I mean, in normal years, we normally are around 13% to 15% extra sales. And now, we are at 13%. So I would say we are sort of at the bottom of the normal range here as well -- as Magnus is saying here, there are AGMs and other type of temporary business that starts to increase going forward as well. So it might be that we have an opportunity here going forward to be a bit higher than we were in Q2. When it comes to then the organic sales growth overall, I mean looking at this, we would say, overall, around 4%, a bit less than that, we would estimate to be price increases and -- sorry, between 4% and 5%, I should say. We estimate to be around price increases and the remaining we see as volume here. And that is then derived from the aviation business recovery, the portfolio growth that we've seen in Europe and Iberia America, but also the strong Electronic Security and Solutions here as well.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [28]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Karl-Johan Bonnevier at DNB Markets.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Karl-Johan Bonnevier,  DNB Markets, Research Division - Analyst   [29]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I appreciate that you want to wait on talking Stanley until the 24th of August and looking forward to that event. But it would be interesting to hear your comments about the 5 countries that you acquired now in 2020. What -- from Stanley, what have you seen in those countries? How have you been able to integrate it? And what kind of impact? And what have you learned, so to say, about the quality of the Stanley after that?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [30]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Karl-Johan. So when you look at those, and I would also include the case in Spain, a company that we acquired at the beginning of 2020 called TECO, that was also a previous Stanley or Niscayah business. What are the common denominators. Well, first of all, we have built more critical mass in most of those markets in terms of Electronic Security and technology capability. And I mentioned that because that is important for relevance in terms of the types of clients and the types of projects that we can take on. So I think that is one because there has been a credibility aspect of this in front of the client that they know that you have the competence, you have the design and the project skills, you have the installations, service and maintenance capabilities to really take on and help us as a client with these types of products. So I think that has been a very important one. And that we have also then seen that, that in combination with back-end synergies. And I mean here, we have been very clear that synergies more to be realized in the back end so that we're protecting commercial capability and resources, we're protecting technical capability engineers, but then trying to make sure that we are driving more common and efficiency as well in the back end. And that has also then meant that in a number of the cases, we have also been able to significantly not only strengthen the market position and the offering but also significant lift in terms of the profitability.\\r\\n And the experience that we have from those 5 plus the sixth one being in Spain, it's highly relevant and also was a strong driver and the reason for our confidence as well about how good it is for us to do this strategic acquisition because it is really a game changer for Securitas, when you're looking at the acquisition that we are doing. And that is very much based on not only on the factors that I mentioned, but also when you're looking at people and culture and what the importance is for a business of also belonging to a company where security and safety is the core. Because that is the important part, and it's also something I've been talking to many of the colleagues as well from Stanley over the last couple of days. When we have welcomed them where we're now joining forces is that they are joining a company where we have 100% focus on security and safety and being at the best in this industry, in this field. And I think that is something that shouldn't be underestimated in terms of the importance for long-term value creation.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Karl-Johan Bonnevier,  DNB Markets, Research Division - Analyst   [31]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Sounds like good premarketing for the 24th. Andreas, just on that note as well, I guess all of us will focus on the deleveraging component, going forward. And when we look at, say, the normal seasonal pattern, obviously, Securitas has a much stronger free cash flow generation in the second half. If you take your comments on organic growth driving some working capital and then there's extra settlement payment in the U.S., is there any reason, if you think about those to not expect Securitas to have a good free cash flow in the second half of this year?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [32]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n So those are 2 components impacting, you're right about that. But in the end, this will also be very much about the work that we can do together with the team in the second half year, which we have done previous years as well, to make sure we get strong collections coming in during the second half and basically work on our DSO list as well because that is the main driver, of course, to our cash flow there, as well. So it is up to us to get back into a normal position here that we have also been able to do in previous years as well. But you're right, we have these 2 components to handle as well in the second half year. So...\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Karl-Johan Bonnevier,  DNB Markets, Research Division - Analyst   [33]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n And your definition of being a good investment case would that be below 3x net debt to EBITDA? Or how would you quantify it?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [34]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n At what point -- at what point in time are you referring to now?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Karl-Johan Bonnevier,  DNB Markets, Research Division - Analyst   [35]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n No, no, not point. Just what level would you consider being good investment grade for your business?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [36]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n But I think exactly -- this will be, of course, one component of interest, and this is exactly something we will come back to here in August, but we will give you a full brief around that instead of commenting around that individually here now.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [37]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n The next question comes from Stefan Knutsson of ABG.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Stefan Knutsson,  ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA, Research Division - Research Analyst   [38]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n My question is regarding the Ibero-America and the operating margin that you already performed there. You're approaching the 6.0% that you aim for in the transformation program. Is it time to raise the ambition or how do you view it?\\r\\n And then the second question is regarding the Stanley acquisition. And since you have closed the acquisition now, can you give any guidance on how much you see will go as amortization of intangibles going forward?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [39]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. Thank you. So on Ibero-America, it is true what you are reflecting on here. I mean, we are performing, I would say, driving improvements at a faster pace than what we would have anticipated. So that obviously then is yes. That's the simple reality. But we will also, when we are talking on the 24th, also provide new financial targets, I think it's prudent as well that we then come back and comment. And I promise to come back to that question in some more detail also in that update.\\r\\n And just on the second question, I mean the strategic logic is strong here. We feel very good, like I said, about the value creation case. We will provide a lot more detail on the 24th. But Andreas, maybe you have just one brief comment here before we continue.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [40]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. You have -- in the report here, you have an estimate related to the amortization of acquisition intangibles. And this is preliminary, of course. But the total amount allocated here is around USD 500 million, mainly then related to customer portfolio, which will be amortized over 15 years. So you will approximately have an amortization charge per year of USD 35 million, still being preliminary, but the information is there in Note 2 as well.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\nOperator   [41]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n (Operator Instructions) There are no further questions at this time. Please go ahead, speakers.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Andreas Lindback,  Securitas AB (publ) - CFO   [42]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n I can also just come back to Sylvia here who had a question around the provision line in itself. And I think I gave the overall answer, and that still stands. But I just want to make it clear there that the bad debt provisions that we took in 2020 are not on the line provisions here. That is a reduction of account receivables. So there is no connection there. And then the movement on the provision line is related to a reduction in our pension liabilities, given the increased interest rate environment here as well. And that is something that goes through equity and not the income statement, to be clear there as well.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Magnus Ahlqvist,  Securitas AB (publ) - President &amp; CEO   [43]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Good. So unless there are any further questions, thank you, everyone, for your engagement. And as we said before, we're looking forward to seeing you for the event on the 24th of August. And in the meantime, everyone in the Northern Hemisphere, wishing then good continued hopefully summer time. Thank you.\\r\\n\",\n",

       "   'text': \"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter call. We continue to execute on our strategy, and this is generating results. When looking at the quarter, we increased the business momentum, continued margin improvement and profit growth. The organic sales growth increased to 6% with strong growth in Europe and Ibero-America. We had negative growth as expected in North America, but are now turning the corner and expecting to return to positive growth in the third quarter. The operating margin increased to 5.8%, and we're now almost 1% higher margin when comparing with the pre-COVID years.\\r\\n North America and Ibero-America are the main contributors and the margin in Europe was stable when comparing to the same period last year. But the external environment continues to be challenging in terms of labor scarcity and inflation, but we are managing well and have a positive price/wage balance year-to-date. And given the circumstances, we will continue to work with dynamic price increases to balance wage increases and importantly, to safeguard the quality of our delivery to our clients.\\r\\n And as is visible in the numbers, a strong focus on improving profitability is now starting to generate real results. We had 13% real sales growth in solutions and Electronic Security, which is a very strong performance with good growth across all segments. And our offering is strong, and we are winning more business at improved margins versus last year. And this, in combination with portfolio management and the impacts from the transformation programs is resulting in higher profitability.\\r\\n And last but not least, we are very proud that Securitas, as the first major security services company, has committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative. Sustainability has always been a focus here at Securitas, but this is further proof of our commitment to continue to deliver sustainable security and safety services and leading the industry also in this important aspect.\\r\\n And as you have hopefully noticed, we were also very glad to announce last week that we have now closed the Stanley Security. And the joint integration preparation work has been solid, and we are very happy and ready to join forces now with the Stanley Security team. And we have planned for an investor update on August 24 to share more about the strategy of the group with new financial targets, and I hope that you are able to join us virtually for that session.\\r\\n So with that, let us now turn in the different business segments. And starting with North America, where, as expected, we did have negative organic growth in the quarter due to the termination of announced low-margin contracts, but also a very significant reduction in COVID-related extra sales compared with the same period last year. But we have good underlying momentum in the North American business. New sales are strong in the Guarding business, and we're managing price increases successfully and in a dynamic manner.\\r\\n The Electronic Security installation business improved in Q2 after a challenging start to the year, but we're still facing challenges related to component shortage and labor shortage. But it is important to note that we had positive organic sales growth, strong order intake and record level backlog in the quarter.\\r\\n And our Pinkerton risk management business is also growing at a healthy pace and contributing. So based on this underlying strength, we are expecting to return to positive organic sales growth in the third quarter.\\r\\n And looking then at the profitability, the margin expansion in North America continues with improvements supported by all business units. The operating margin of 7.4% is the highest ever achieved in North America. And there are a number of reasons behind this. And starting with the Guarding business, there are a few key drivers behind the positive development. The business transformation program that we finished last year, active portfolio management and an increase in solution sales are all contributing to the positive development.\\r\\n Looking at Electronic Security, we had an improved business mix and also solid execution by our team, and that also contributed to the results. The development of our Pinkerton business was also solid, and we also had a positive contribution from the Critical Infrastructure Services business.\\r\\n So when you're looking at North America, we have undertaken significant modernization and digitization on North America business with significant investments over the last couple of years. And our team's execution of the strategy is now generating results with structurally higher margins.\\r\\n So with that, let us then shift the focus to Europe, where we had very strong growth of 9% in the quarter. And there are a few factors contributing to the growth. First, we had positive portfolio development. So that means the strong commercial momentum is resulting in positive portfolio growth also when excluding price increases. Secondly, the aviation business is returning to more normalized levels of demand. This also contributed. And third, we are increasing prices at significantly higher rates than normal to balance wage increases.\\r\\n But I'm also very glad to report that we had solid growth in sales of Solutions and Electronic Security in Europe in the quarter, and that also had a real positive impact on the sales growth.\\r\\n And looking at the profitability, the margin of 5.5% was stable versus the same quarter last year despite the challenges related to sickness and labor shortages. At active portfolio management as well as previously acquired Electronic Security businesses contributed positively to the margin.\\r\\n Sickness rates and the cost related to labor shortages improved somewhat versus the first quarter but are still impacting the bottom line in a negative way. And as was the case in the first quarter, these challenges are more pronounced in a few markets in Europe and in the rest of the countries, we are managing quite well.\\r\\n Cost measures and some leverage from the strong growth also helped the margin. So when looking ahead, we expect the labor market in Europe to remain challenging, and we continue to work in a more dynamic manner to balance wage increases with price increases. And apart from that, we're also actively promoting connected technology and integrated solutions to our clients as a means to improve the security equation and managing total cost for our clients.\\r\\n And moving then to Ibero-America, where we have continued very positive development in terms of top line growth but also profitability. And in Spain, we had organic sales growth of 10% in the quarter with a strong development across the business. Latin America improved compared to last year, but price increases in Argentina were the primary driver from a Latin American perspective, contribution to the growth. And the good momentum with sales of Security Solutions and Electronic Security continued. These sales are now representing 30% of total sales.\\r\\n But we also have very strong development in terms of profitability. Our Ibero-America team are executing on the strategy, create a sharper and more profitable business, and this is paying off. The operating margin is 40 to 50 basis points higher versus the same period last year and more than 1% higher when comparing with the pre-COVID periods. And the improvement is driven by Spain, Portugal, but we also had positive contribution from most countries in Latin America that are performing at a higher level.\\r\\n So all in all, a strong quarter, strong continued development of the overall business. And I think with that, I hand over to Andreas for some more details regarding the financials.\"},\n",

       "   'text': \"Thank you, Magnus, and good afternoon, everyone. We start, as always, with our income statement here. The second quarter was as Magnus mentioned, a strong quarter with solid growth and an improving operating margin at 5.8%.\\r\\n The operating margin is not only strong when comparing to last year, but also substantially higher than the pre-COVID Q2 levels at around 5%, confirming that our execution of the strategy is on the right way. The margin development was supported by strong double-digit growth in the high-margin solutions and Electronic Security business. And the teams have done a really good job with the price/wage balance, which so far in the year are contributing to the margin.\\r\\n I should highlight that the operating result in the second quarter did not include any material government grants related to COVID-19 and the number of people on temporary unemployment was on very low levels. One accounting update, here in the second quarter, is that Turkey, as from April 1, is considered hyperinflationary for the purpose of the reporting under IAS 29 hyperinflation. As you know, we have also applied IAS 29 for our operations in Argentina since Q3 2018. It is a straightforward standard from the perspective that it targets to give better insight into the effect from high inflation, both related to the balance sheet and the income statement. The implementation of this standard is, however, fairly technical in nature. And to keep it simple here related to Turkey, the impact on Securitas is not material, as you can also see on Page 9 in the report under the table for security services Europe. The impact on the balance sheet related to Turkey is an increase in capital employed of SEK 463 million and the same amount increased in equity. That relates to the revaluation that we then do on the opening balance sheet on April 1. Then during the quarter, we have reevaluated the income statement and the balance sheet as well. The conclusion of that is that there is almost no effect on sales nor operating results. The most significant impact is within the financial items line with a positive effect of SEK 17 million. We have continued to treat the effects from the standard similar to currency impact. This means that none of our key ratios, such as organic growth or real change are impacted from bringing Turkey in. You'll find more details around this in Note 8 of the report.\\r\\n If we then have a look below the operating result. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was SEK 61 million in the quarter, basically the same number as in the first quarter and nothing major to report here.\\r\\n Looking at the acquisition-related costs, they were again limited in the quarter as our acquisition activity is reduced after the announcement of the Stanley transaction. We have posted acquisitions to focus on the Stanley integration and deleveraging of our balance sheet position. There may be 1 or 2 smaller exceptions to this, but there will be nothing major in the coming quarters. So we expect the acquisition-related costs to be lower than 2021 for the full year. Remember here that the acquisition costs related to Stanley is reported under items affecting comparability.\\r\\n Going then to exactly that, items affecting comparability. Here, we had SEK 226 million of cost in the quarter, which is approximately SEK 30 million less than last year. The reduction is a consequence of us closing down 3 programs at the end of 2021. Of the SEK 226 million, SEK 169 million was related to the ongoing European and Ibero-America transformation programs and the residual SEK 57 million was paid transaction costs related to the Stanley acquisition. And I will come back with some more information here on the next page.\\r\\n If we then have a look at the financial net. Here, we had a SEK 30 million reduction in cost in the quarter. The underlying interest cost increased somewhat due to the increased interest rates that we are seeing, but we had some smaller positive FX impacts and together with around SEK 30 million positive impact from IAS-29. That explains the difference here.\\r\\n As I mentioned earlier, SEK 17 million is related to Turkey and the residual is related to Argentina, referencing then the SEK 30 million IAS-29 impact. Given the high inflation and increased interest rate in the market, we are expecting to see an increased financial net for the full year 2022, when we compare to 2021, also then excluding the impacts of the hyperinflation. This is, of course, also excluding the finance costs related to Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n Looking at the tax. The tax rate forecast for the full year remains at 27.0%, and there are basically no major news in this forecast.\\r\\n On the next slide, we have some additional information related then to the programs we are running under items affecting comparability. Important here is that we closed down 3 programs at the end of last year, which is reducing the complexity here. In North America, the team is continuing to execute on realizing the benefits from the North America transformation program that we implemented last year. We see positive margin impacts from the program in 2022, and there is further potential here going forward. The European and Ibero-America transformation programs are continuing the execution. The programs are on track, and we will, over the coming quarters, start to go live in phases with new digital platforms in several countries. We have an important year ahead of us in terms of execution here.\\r\\n The items affecting comparability related to these programs were SEK 169 million in the second quarter, and our estimate for the full year is between SEK 550 million and SEK 600 million. And this then also includes the impact from the cloud computing accounting regulations implemented and communicated in Q4.\\r\\n We have, as I mentioned, also occurred SEK 57 million of costs related to the Stanley acquisition in the quarter. Totally, since the announcement, we have spent SEK 132 million of the approximately SEK 1.4 billion transaction integration and restructuring costs related to the acquisition. The plan is that the majority of these costs will be expensed over 2022 and 2023.\\r\\n Moving then to the next page, where we have an overview of the FX impact on the income statement. There were major impacts from FX in the quarter, mainly related to the U.S. dollar that appreciated 19% to the Swedish krona compared to last year. The total FX impact on sales was 9% in the second quarter, mainly then driven by the U.S. dollar, while the euro appreciated 5%.\\r\\n Looking at our operating result, the FX impact was a bit higher at 12%, mainly due to the higher profitability levels in our North American business and the currency impact increased further when looking at EPS. The EPS real change before items affecting comparability was solid at 10% in the quarter and 11% for the first 6 months with good cost leverage on the items below operating result. Including the items affecting comparability, the real change was even a bit stronger coming from the reduced IC spend this year.\\r\\n We then move to cash flow. The cash flow from operating activities was SEK 927 million or 53% of the operating result in the second quarter, a good improvement compared to the first quarter and a solid Q2 outcome, taking into consideration the current high growth that we are seeing in the business. If we look into the larger movements here in the quarter, we saw an increase in CapEx of almost SEK 190 million. We saw an increase in our investments into our solution contracts, which confirms the positive momentum we have in the high-margin solutions business. A major part of the increase was also related to the existing transformation programs, which are progressing according to plan.\\r\\n The CapEx to sales was 2.8% in the quarter, and we continue to expect to come in below 3% for the year. The account receivables was minus SEK 873 million. And here, we see the impact from the strong growth that we are seeing in the business. Growth consumes cash for us as we normally are paying our employees ahead of getting paid from our clients. We also see a slight impact on the DSO from the price increase measures that we have successfully executed, where it takes a bit of time to conclude with the clients on these negotiations and then get back to normal again.\\r\\n We have a strong focus and attention in the divisions and in the countries to ensure we keep this on track in the second half year. Looking then at the free cash flow in Q2, which ended up at almost SEK 500 million. This is an improvement both in absolute and percentage terms compared to last year and was supported by reduced tax payments in the U.S. related to preliminary federal tax. Last year in Q2, we made larger true-up payments related to 2020, and this was now back to normal levels this year, having a positive impact when comparing the quarters. So we are reasonably satisfied with the second quarter cash flow. We are still behind for the first half year after the weaker Q1, where the main reasons was related to account receivables, where we had flat growth and a low DSO position at the end of last year, which impacted the first quarter.\\r\\n Last year, we also had positive payroll timing impacts in both the U.S. and The Netherlands of approximately SEK 600 million benefit in Q1. These payroll time and differences were neutral on a full-year basis 2021. Going forward, we should also remember that we will still pay the final SEK 600 million of corona-related time and relief measures that we benefited from in 2020 in North America, and this we will pay in Q4 this year.\\r\\n So we continue to have high focus on cash flow given the current macroeconomical environment and the Stanley transaction. Combined with the normal seasonality of a stronger second half year cash flow, we are working here to make sure we have a solid 2022 outcome here.\\r\\n We then go to the slide related to net debt. Our net debt increased with approximately SEK 3.9 billion in the first 6 months compared to the beginning of the year. The main reason for the increase is the regular dividend of SEK 1.6 billion paid in the second quarter. IAC related payments of close to SEK 500 million and a material FX translation impact of almost SEK 1.3 billion. Combining this with a negative free cash flow for the first half year and an increase in lease liabilities, mainly related to new office leases, the net debt ended up at SEK 18.4 million. Our net debt-to-EBITDA came in at 2.2%. This is flat compared to June last year, but with a 0.2% increase compared to Q1, mainly related to the regular dividend payment. As you know, our financial target is 2.5%, and we continue to be below this target preparing ahead of the Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n Moving on to the next slide and looking at our financial position and debt maturity short. As you know, we have a solid financing in place today. None of our facilities have any financial covenants and the liquidity position is strong. In April, we extended our EUR 938 million RCF for another year into 2027. And now in July, we added one more bank into the facility, increasing the number of banks to 11, and the total facility amount is then a bit more than EUR 1 billion, preparing here, of course, to become a larger group after the Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n As you also know since before, we have a bridge facility in place related to the USD 3.2 billion Stanley transaction, and we used this facility now on July 22 when paying the purchase price at closing. The bridge facility will be refinanced with a mix of debt and equity, where the rights issue will be approximately USD 950 million. We will launch the rights issue now in September, and there will be further details coming around this in the near-term future. We will thereafter also focus on the debt takeout where the exact timing is still to be decided.\\r\\n Looking at our rating. Here, we have been on credit watch by Standard &amp; Poor as a consequence of the announced Stanley transaction. As the transaction closed now, S&amp;P confirmed early this week that our update grading now is BBB minus with stable outlook, which was also in line with our expectations. So we reiterate our commitment to remain investment grade here, and we will focus on deleveraging our balance sheet going forward.\\r\\n And with that, I now hand back to Magnus.\"},\n",

       "   'text': \"Many thanks, Andreas. I would like to share just a few updates related to our transformation programs and the Stanley acquisition before we open up for the Q&amp;A. And starting with the transformation programs, we concluded the North American global IT programs at the end of 2021. And as previously mentioned, the investments made are now starting to generate returns, thanks to modern platforms and tools that enable us to optimize the business like never before. And we're also executing according to plan with the programs in Europe and Ibero-America. The European program is comprehensive. And if you're looking at the last 12 months, we have strengthened the solutions organization to drive improvement in the business mix. And during the coming 6 to 12 months, we're starting to transition to new systems and applications in some of the key markets.\\r\\n And all this work is fundamentally important to create a modern, digitally capable and more efficient Securitas. And this work also gives us a stronger foundation to leverage modern systems and applications when we are integrating the Stanley Security businesses.\\r\\n And a few words about Stanley. So by joining forces, we are building the foundation to be the leading intelligent security solutions partner. We become the most attractive choice for clients with a clearly differentiated offering and with world-leading technology and expertise. And technology is becoming increasingly important for our clients. And together with Stanley, we're shifting the profile of Securitas in terms of the offering to our clients and value creation. This is also immediately margin accretive. Over 50% of the contribution to operating results will come from higher value and higher growth solutions and Electronic Security.\\r\\n And we have received a tremendous response from our clients regarding the opportunities that this combination will bring. And together with Stanley, we are in a solid position to create an outstanding team, which is perfectly placed to win in the security services industry.\\r\\n So to conclude this, before we open up the Q&amp;A, we are executing on our strategy, and this is generating results. We increased the margin to 5.8% in the quarter and recorded 11% EPS growth in the first half of the year. And this is despite the turbulent external environment, and I am very proud of our team, which is delivering results today and at the same time, building the new Securitas. And that is the Securitas which is modern, digitized and innovative security solutions company.\\r\\n But before we open up to Q&amp;A, related to the Stanley acquisition, I understand that there is a lot of interest and questions. And for this reason, I would like to mention once again that we have arranged an Investor Update on August 24. And in that session, we will share an update of the strategy, a lot more detail related to the importance of the Stanley Security acquisition. And like I mentioned before, updated financial targets for the group.\\r\\n And by the 24th of August, we have also owned the business for a little bit more than a month. And my request today is that we then take all the Stanley-related questions in that session.\\r\\n So with that, happy to open up the Q&amp;A.\"}],\n",
       " 'presentation_colapsed': \"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter call. We continue to execute on our strategy, and this is generating results. When looking at the quarter, we increased the business momentum, continued margin improvement and profit growth. The organic sales growth increased to 6% with strong growth in Europe and Ibero-America. We had negative growth as expected in North America, but are now turning the corner and expecting to return to positive growth in the third quarter. The operating margin increased to 5.8%, and we're now almost 1% higher margin when comparing with the pre-COVID years.\\r\\n North America and Ibero-America are the main contributors and the margin in Europe was stable when comparing to the same period last year. But the external environment continues to be challenging in terms of labor scarcity and inflation, but we are managing well and have a positive price/wage balance year-to-date. And given the circumstances, we will continue to work with dynamic price increases to balance wage increases and importantly, to safeguard the quality of our delivery to our clients.\\r\\n And as is visible in the numbers, a strong focus on improving profitability is now starting to generate real results. We had 13% real sales growth in solutions and Electronic Security, which is a very strong performance with good growth across all segments. And our offering is strong, and we are winning more business at improved margins versus last year. And this, in combination with portfolio management and the impacts from the transformation programs is resulting in higher profitability.\\r\\n And last but not least, we are very proud that Securitas, as the first major security services company, has committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative.

The EPS real change before items affecting comparability was solid at 10% in the quarter and 11% for the first 6 months with good cost leverage on the items below operating result. Including the items affecting comparability, the real change was even a bit stronger coming from the reduced IC spend this year.\\r\\n We then move to cash flow. The cash flow from operating activities was SEK 927 million or 53% of the operating result in the second quarter, a good improvement compared to the first quarter and a solid Q2 outcome, taking into consideration the current high growth that we are seeing in the business. If we look into the larger movements here in the quarter, we saw an increase in CapEx of almost SEK 190 million. We saw an increase in our investments into our solution contracts, which confirms the positive momentum we have in the high-margin solutions business. A major part of the increase was also related to the existing transformation programs, which are progressing according to plan.\\r\\n The CapEx to sales was 2.8% in the quarter, and we continue to expect to come in below 3% for the year. The account receivables was minus SEK 873 million. And here, we see the impact from the strong growth that we are seeing in the business. Growth consumes cash for us as we normally are paying our employees ahead of getting paid from our clients. We also see a slight impact on the DSO from the price increase measures that we have successfully executed, where it takes a bit of time to conclude with the clients on these negotiations and then get back to normal again.\\r\\n We have a strong focus and attention in the divisions and in the countries to ensure we keep this on track in the second half year. Looking then at the free cash flow in Q2, which ended up at almost SEK 500 million. This is an improvement both in absolute and percentage terms compared to last year and was supported by reduced tax payments in the U.S. related to preliminary federal tax. Last year in Q2, we made larger true-up payments related to 2020, and this was now back to normal levels this year, having a positive impact when comparing the quarters. So we are reasonably satisfied with the second quarter cash flow. We are still behind for the first half year after the weaker Q1, where the main reasons was related to account receivables, where we had flat growth and a low DSO position at the end of last year, which impacted the first quarter.\\r\\n Last year, we also had positive payroll timing impacts in both the U.S. and The Netherlands of approximately SEK 600 million benefit in Q1. These payroll time and differences were neutral on a full-year basis 2021. Going forward, we should also remember that we will still pay the final SEK 600 million of corona-related time and relief measures that we benefited from in 2020 in North America, and this we will pay in Q4 this year.\\r\\n So we continue to have high focus on cash flow given the current macroeconomical environment and the Stanley transaction. Combined with the normal seasonality of a stronger second half year cash flow, we are working here to make sure we have a solid 2022 outcome here.\\r\\n We then go to the slide related to net debt. Our net debt increased with approximately SEK 3.9 billion in the first 6 months compared to the beginning of the year. The main reason for the increase is the regular dividend of SEK 1.6 billion paid in the second quarter. IAC related payments of close to SEK 500 million and a material FX translation impact of almost SEK 1.3 billion. Combining this with a negative free cash flow for the first half year and an increase in lease liabilities, mainly related to new office leases, the net debt ended up at SEK 18.4 million. Our net debt-to-EBITDA came in at 2.2%. This is flat compared to June last year, but with a 0.2% increase compared to Q1, mainly related to the regular dividend payment. As you know, our financial target is 2.5%, and we continue to be below this target preparing ahead of the Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n Moving on to the next slide and looking at our financial position and debt maturity short. As you know, we have a solid financing in place today. None of our facilities have any financial covenants and the liquidity position is strong. In April, we extended our EUR 938 million RCF for another year into 2027. And now in July, we added one more bank into the facility, increasing the number of banks to 11, and the total facility amount is then a bit more than EUR 1 billion, preparing here, of course, to become a larger group after the Stanley acquisition.\\r\\n As you also know since before, we have a bridge facility in place related to the USD 3.2 billion Stanley transaction, and we used this facility now on July 22 when paying the purchase price at closing. The bridge facility will be refinanced with a mix of debt and equity, where the rights issue will be approximately USD 950 million. We will launch the rights issue now in September, and there will be further details coming around this in the near-term future. We will thereafter also focus on the debt takeout where the exact timing is still to be decided.\\r\\n Looking at our rating. Here, we have been on credit watch by Standard &amp; Poor as a consequence of the announced Stanley transaction. As the transaction closed now, S&amp;P confirmed early this week that our update grading now is BBB minus with stable outlook, which was also in line with our expectations. So we reiterate our commitment to remain investment grade here, and we will focus on deleveraging our balance sheet going forward.\\r\\n And with that, I now hand back to Magnus. Many thanks, Andreas. I would like to share just a few updates related to our transformation programs and the Stanley acquisition before we open up for the Q&amp;A. And starting with the transformation programs, we concluded the North American global IT programs at the end of 2021. And as previously mentioned, the investments made are now starting to generate returns, thanks to modern platforms and tools that enable us to optimize the business like never before. And we're also executing according to plan with the programs in Europe and Ibero-America. The European program is comprehensive. And if you're looking at the last 12 months, we have strengthened the solutions organization to drive improvement in the business mix. And during the coming 6 to 12 months, we're starting to transition to new systems and applications in some of the key markets.\\r\\n And all this work is fundamentally important to create a modern, digitally capable and more efficient Securitas. And this work also gives us a stronger foundation to leverage modern systems and applications when we are integrating the Stanley Security businesses.\\r\\n And a few words about Stanley. So by joining forces, we are building the foundation to be the leading intelligent security solutions partner. We become the most attractive choice for clients with a clearly differentiated offering and with world-leading technology and expertise. And technology is becoming increasingly important for our clients. And together with Stanley, we're shifting the profile of Securitas in terms of the offering to our clients and value creation. This is also immediately margin accretive. Over 50% of the contribution to operating results will come from higher value and higher growth solutions and Electronic Security.\\r\\n And we have received a tremendous response from our clients regarding the opportunities that this combination will bring. And together with Stanley, we are in a solid position to create an outstanding team, which is perfectly placed to win in the security services industry.\\r\\n So to conclude this, before we open up the Q&amp;A, we are executing on our strategy, and this is generating results. We increased the margin to 5.8% in the quarter and recorded 11% EPS growth in the first half of the year. And this is despite the turbulent external environment, and I am very proud of our team, which is delivering results today and at the same time, building the new Securitas. And that is the Securitas which is modern, digitized and innovative security solutions company.\\r\\n But before we open up to Q&amp;A, related to the Stanley acquisition, I understand that there is a lot of interest and questions. And for this reason, I would like to mention once again that we have arranged an Investor Update on August 24. And in that session, we will share an update of the strategy, a lot more detail related to the importance of the Stanley Security acquisition. And like I mentioned before, updated financial targets for the group.\\r\\n And by the 24th of August, we have also owned the business for a little bit more than a month. And my request today is that we then take all the Stanley-related questions in that session.\\r\\n So with that, happy to open up the Q&amp;A.\",\n",

My second question is on volumes. It seems as if volumes have slowed from being flat in Q1 to negative 3% in Q2. If you could give us any sort of color on what's driven that? And then finally, it seems that you've reduced the range for your items affecting comparability to SEK 550 million to SEK 600 million from -- from SEK 500 million to SEK 600 million to SEK 550 million to SEK 600 million.

       "   'text': \"Yes. So thank you for the questions. On the margin, I mean, we are not breaking out the exact numbers behind. But when you're looking at this, I think, #1, we have had a consistent focus on ensuring that we are enhancing the profitability of the business. And this work is something that I think when you're looking at North America, even though we have organic sales growth, which is negative in the quarter, we are significantly expanding the margin. And that's a combination of a couple of different factors. One, of course, is portfolio management that we are carefully managing all contracts, and that is more important in this environment than ever before when there is labor scarcity. Another point is that the transformation program in North America is also operating -- I mean helping us to operate in a more efficient way. Another important driver is that we are driving very strong growth in terms of solutions and Electronic Security, which has a higher margin profile. And there, if you're looking at the overall group, 13% real sales growth compared to the same quarter last year. But then we've also undertaken quite a number of measures to make sure that we are running the business in a focused way, obviously, also have some positive impact from leverage in terms of the profitability, which is also helping thanks to the growth.\\r\\n Looking at the volume question, I'm not entirely sure that I understood the analysis there because if you're looking at the growth in the second quarter, there is a fairly significant piece, which is coming from price increases. That's the majority. There is also some volume growth in Europe and in Ibero-America, if you're looking at the portfolio. But one area that where we are significantly lower today compared to a year ago is in the extra sales. And we've highlighted that in 2020 and 2021, we were operating significantly higher extra sales levels, and that was most pronounced in North America, when you're looking at the decline between Q2 '21 to Q2 '22. So that is also one important factor, but there we're also expecting that extra sales, and we're also starting to see some indications that the kind of the normal extra sales that we would typically have, which is more event related, et cetera. I mean that is also gradually starting to come back.\\r\\n So I think that those are really the key points in terms of volume. But just to reiterate that point is that there is positive volume growth also excluding price increases in Europe and Ibero-America in the second quarter. So that is also a driver behind the growth.\\r\\n Maybe on the ISC, Andreas, if you want to comment on that one.\"},\n",

So that is also contributing when you're looking at the margin improvements overall.\\r\\n On the items affecting comparability here, we gave a guidance of SEK 500 million to SEK 600 million in the previous quarter here. That was in the first quarter, of course. And then the further we're getting into the years, I mean the plan gets more and more clear. So then we can narrow down the forecast that we are seeing for the year. So you shouldn't see it as anything else than that. I mean we are now more confident that we will be around the SEK 550 million, SEK 600 million. So that's why we have made the window more narrow, and it's not any indications of changes for next year in any way.\"},\n",

Question #2, just to understand, so the Turkey official inflation has picked up again in Q2 relative to Q1.

So can you maybe just give us some figures on how much Turkey and Argentina contributed to organic growth in the quarter?\\r\\n And then finally, on Electronics.

If you're looking at the Turkey inflation, that and Argentina, together, we estimate around 2% impact on the organic sales growth in the quarter, those 2 combined. On Electronic Security, important here, I mean, we had -- and it was a tough start of the year. And that was a mix of a couple of different factors. One was COVID-related. And COVID related, it's sick leave among our people, technicians, for example, to be able to carry out installation projects. Also then COVID-related in the sense that we had a number of clients also then not allowing, due to restrictions, then access to their premises. But we started to see this improving in the second quarter. And we expect that to continuously improve as well as the situation is hopefully normalizing.\\r\\n But the other aspect of this is also the component shortages because that is still a major factor when you're looking at the Electronic Security projects and installation business because there has been a lot of instability and not reliable or availability in terms of supply of components. So that has really had an impact. But we did have positive growth in North America in the second quarter. So that was positive.

And then probably there is a little bit of mix benefit that was there. So just wondering how much this transformation programs are really contributing? Or if there is anything underlying, which is offsetting the impact. And I know you sort of answer the question of the Stanley deal later.

       "   'text': \"Good. Thank you. So on the margin in North America, the transformation program is clearly helping. And just to give some flavor in terms of how? I mean, we have upgraded from old systems, very many ways of working to now be significant -- I mean, completely digitized end-to-end in terms of how we're working with -- in everything that we do in terms of our employees in the frontline, like officers, all the way to invoicing our clients. The big benefit here is that we have significantly better transparency and visibility, significantly better decision-making support for our leaders that are managing the business at different levels all the way out to equivalent of a branch manager. So that is clearly helping. And there, I mean, we had some benefit in 2021 -- it's difficult to break out the exact impact, but that benefit is definitely increasing in 2022 and really contributing to the very strong margin delivery. Because we're delivering this also in an external environment, which is really challenging from a labor scarcity perspective.\\r\\n So I think that is to provide some context in terms of the North America transformation program. When I look at Europe, when you're looking at Ibero-America, I mean, there we are at a much earlier stage in terms of the programs. I mentioned a little bit related to Europe that, I mean, there, it's much more than just harmonizing the way of working and upgrading systems and tools. It's also then really helping us starting to shape and change the business mix towards more integrated solutions. There, we have done quite some investments and also starting to see some positive results. And that is also helping and driving more solutions momentum in Europe, and that by itself also has a positive impact on the margin. But like I said, that program, it's much, much early days and more of the work, but also more of the benefit to come over the next couple of years.\"},\n",

And just to remind, they were very significant in size, around $50 million, an aviation contract that we terminated last summer. And then the other contract was around $150 million that we terminated in December 2021. So that is the reason. The commercial momentum in North America is really strong. We are selling at a high pace with the good margins. So I would say the commercial activity is positive. And I would also just emphasize as well is that, I mean, we are 100% focused on protecting the value of our business. When we talk about active portfolio management, we are not seeking to just add a lot of volume and volume, and volume. It has to be good margins and good values that we can defend the quality and also continues to invest in the relationship and the delivery with our clients. And we are sticking to that. And I think that is also working because we are defending, thanks to very good quality but also continuously strengthening the offering. And here, obviously, in the technology space as well and with the transformation programs, it also enables us to operate in a stronger way. So that is some of the flavors. So no concern whatsoever from my perspective in terms of client retention. But we're obviously always humble in terms of how we are working with the clients, but we are very firm in terms of the profitability requirements for the reasons I mentioned.\\r\\n The airport business, yes, that is now more normalized. And that contract portfolio, as you remember, we did very significant portfolio management and cleanup activities to make sure that we had a healthy portfolio during the worst part of the pandemic. We are now seeing the results of that. So when we're looking from a profitability perspective, that profitability is now up and in line with the group average more or less. So it's a better quality portfolio when things are now hopefully normalizing as we're coming out of the worst year from the pandemic.\"},\n",

       "   'text': \"Just 2 for me. Just firstly, you talked a little bit about the extra sales declines from the numbers we saw during COVID. Is there any way you can try and help us by quantifying the step down you're still seeing versus last year? And also I'd be interested just to hear about where we are in those extra sales versus the pre-COVID levels, i.e., you sort of suggested it was kind of normalizing, but is that back at the kind of pre-COVID levels. Now that's the first question. And then secondly, just to follow back on the organic growth breakdown or kind of the building blocks. You said that 2% was hyperinflation. But maybe can you split the rest between what's normal price increases? Maybe what's kind of COVID recovery and then what's underlying volume growth in there as well. So that type of split would be really helpful.\"},\n",

       "   'text': \"Thank you, Allen. So I mean to be specific on the extra sales, it's roughly 3% less as the share of sales this year compared to last year. So a significant reduction. And that is most pronounced in North America in the second quarter because there we were also running with significantly higher COVID-related extra sales in Q2 last year. And that is -- I mean that business is no longer there. So I think that -- and to your second question, related to the extra sales, we are now at levels that are more kind of normal levels. Some quarters, it's going to be a little bit higher than where we are right now. If we're looking -- if the past is a good guidance related to the future. And we're also starting to see that, that more and more events are starting to come back, but it's also been a little bit tentative. If you're looking at the things that we are doing, AGMs, for example, we might be doing quite a lot of when it's AGM season, sports events, other industry type of events across different verticals, et cetera. And those, as you know, in some areas, they've kind of started to resume normal activity in some areas not. And those are obviously activities that we will typically also benefit our extra sales and even if on a temporary basis. But that's also the whole definition of the extra sales of the temp business, as we call it. So I hope that gives the flavor.

       " 'qa_colapsed': \"Yes. So thank you for the questions. On the margin, I mean, we are not breaking out the exact numbers behind. But when you're looking at this, I think, #1, we have had a consistent focus on ensuring that we are enhancing the profitability of the business. And this work is something that I think when you're looking at North America, even though we have organic sales growth, which is negative in the quarter, we are significantly expanding the margin. And that's a combination of a couple of different factors. One, of course, is portfolio management that we are carefully managing all contracts, and that is more important in this environment than ever before when there is labor scarcity. Another point is that the transformation program in North America is also operating -- I mean helping us to operate in a more efficient way. Another important driver is that we are driving very strong growth in terms of solutions and Electronic Security, which has a higher margin profile. And there, if you're looking at the overall group, 13% real sales growth compared to the same quarter last year. But then we've also undertaken quite a number of measures to make sure that we are running the business in a focused way, obviously, also have some positive impact from leverage in terms of the profitability, which is also helping thanks to the growth.\\r\\n Looking at the volume question, I'm not entirely sure that I understood the analysis there because if you're looking at the growth in the second quarter, there is a fairly significant piece, which is coming from price increases. That's the majority. There is also some volume growth in Europe and in Ibero-America, if you're looking at the portfolio. But one area that where we are significantly lower today compared to a year ago is in the extra sales. And we've highlighted that in 2020 and 2021, we were operating significantly higher extra sales levels, and that was most pronounced in North America, when you're looking at the decline between Q2 '21 to Q2 '22. So that is also one important factor, but there we're also expecting that extra sales, and we're also starting to see some indications that the kind of the normal extra sales that we would typically have, which is more event related, et cetera. I mean that is also gradually starting to come back.\\r\\n So I think that those are really the key points in terms of volume. But just to reiterate that point is that there is positive volume growth also excluding price increases in Europe and Ibero-America in the second quarter. So that is also a driver behind the growth.\\r\\n Maybe on the ISC, Andreas, if you want to comment on that one. I can just add there on the margin as well. I mean, we had really strong price/wage management, as we have said here as well. So that is also contributing when you're looking at the margin improvements overall.\\r\\n On the items affecting comparability here, we gave a guidance of SEK 500 million to SEK 600 million in the previous quarter here. That was in the first quarter, of course. And then the further we're getting into the years, I mean the plan gets more and more clear. So then we can narrow down the forecast that we are seeing for the year. So you shouldn't see it as anything else than that. I mean we are now more confident that we will be around the SEK 550 million, SEK 600 million. So that's why we have made the window more narrow, and it's not any indications of changes for next year in any way. Thank you, Sylvia. I will take questions #2 and 3, and then I hand back to Andreas on the provisions. If you're looking at the Turkey inflation, that and Argentina, together, we estimate around 2% impact on the organic sales growth in the quarter, those 2 combined. On Electronic Security, important here, I mean, we had -- and it was a tough start of the year. And that was a mix of a couple of different factors. One was COVID-related. And COVID related, it's sick leave among our people, technicians, for example, to be able to carry out installation projects. Also then COVID-related in the sense that we had a number of clients also then not allowing, due to restrictions, then access to their premises. But we started to see this improving in the second quarter. And we expect that to continuously improve as well as the situation is hopefully normalizing.\\r\\n But the other aspect of this is also the component shortages because that is still a major factor when you're looking at the Electronic Security projects and installation business because there has been a lot of instability and not reliable or availability in terms of supply of components. So that has really had an impact. But we did have positive growth in North America in the second quarter. So that was positive. And we also had positive growth in Europe in the second quarter and also the 2 major ones in terms of the ES business. Related to the provisions, basically, it's been a normal quarter here. So we have not touched any of the provisions that you mentioned here, Sylvia. And then, of course, you have ordinary course of business as well during the quarter. But related to the provisions we took in 2020, we have not touched those. No, I would say Sylvia it's been an ordinary quarter from that perspective. So there is nothing that is sticking out. Good. Thank you. So on the margin in North America, the transformation program is clearly helping. And just to give some flavor in terms of how? I mean, we have upgraded from old systems, very many ways of working to now be significant -- I mean, completely digitized end-to-end in terms of how we're working with -- in everything that we do in terms of our employees in the frontline, like officers, all the way to invoicing our clients. The big benefit here is that we have significantly better transparency and visibility, significantly better decision-making support for our leaders that are managing the business at different levels all the way out to equivalent of a branch manager. So that is clearly helping. And there, I mean, we had some benefit in 2021 -- it's difficult to break out the exact impact, but that benefit is definitely increasing in 2022 and really contributing to the very strong margin delivery. Because we're delivering this also in an external environment, which is really challenging from a labor scarcity perspective.\\r\\n So I think that is to provide some context in terms of the North America transformation program. When I look at Europe, when you're looking at Ibero-America, I mean, there we are at a much earlier stage in terms of the programs. I mentioned a little bit related to Europe that, I mean, there, it's much more than just harmonizing the way of working and upgrading systems and tools. It's also then really helping us starting to shape and change the business mix towards more integrated solutions. There, we have done quite some investments and also starting to see some positive results. And that is also helping and driving more solutions momentum in Europe, and that by itself also has a positive impact on the margin. But like I said, that program, it's much, much early days and more of the work, but also more of the benefit to come over the next couple of years. Related to the bridge facility there, I mean first of all, the bridges are normal commercial terms, I would say, without going into the details there, but they are also long in nature here. We have up to 24 months in terms of duration on these bridges as well. So from that position, we're sitting in a good position. Then you can also say, of course, that we signed these bridge facilities in a different market back in 2021 as well, which is not the negative thing here, given the developments in the debt market since. So I hope that gives you some flavor here related to the bridge. Because basically, we go out to our clients then and need to make sure that we get the right price increases in place, like Magnus said here, it's a very dynamic market where we have also been pushing out fairly high price increases. And of course, that is always a discussion together with our clients, where you also need to agree in the end on the final number. So that takes a bit longer time than in a normal year, where it's less numbers and it's also more straightforward. No. But that's not what I'm saying. It also takes longer time to negotiate as well, which is also then -- which is then also impacting the DSO. But the second point to highlight here as well, as I mentioned, if you're looking at the first half year is that we also had a very low DSO position by the end of last year, after a really strong cash print. So that is also impacting us here negatively as well. But then, of course, we need to make sure that we have a really solid also cash focus in the second quarter -- the second half year here as well. Thank you. Yes, your assumption is correct. That low retention rate is related to those low-margin contract terminations. And just to remind, they were very significant in size, around $50 million, an aviation contract that we terminated last summer. And then the other contract was around $150 million that we terminated in December 2021. So that is the reason. The commercial momentum in North America is really strong. We are selling at a high pace with the good margins. So I would say the commercial activity is positive. And I would also just emphasize as well is that, I mean, we are 100% focused on protecting the value of our business. When we talk about active portfolio management, we are not seeking to just add a lot of volume and volume, and volume. It has to be good margins and good values that we can defend the quality and also continues to invest in the relationship and the delivery with our clients. And we are sticking to that. And I think that is also working because we are defending, thanks to very good quality but also continuously strengthening the offering. And here, obviously, in the technology space as well and with the transformation programs, it also enables us to operate in a stronger way. So that is some of the flavors. So no concern whatsoever from my perspective in terms of client retention. But we're obviously always humble in terms of how we are working with the clients, but we are very firm in terms of the profitability requirements for the reasons I mentioned.\\r\\n The airport business, yes, that is now more normalized. And that contract portfolio, as you remember, we did very significant portfolio management and cleanup activities to make sure that we had a healthy portfolio during the worst part of the pandemic. We are now seeing the results of that. So when we're looking from a profitability perspective, that profitability is now up and in line with the group average more or less. So it's a better quality portfolio when things are now hopefully normalizing as we're coming out of the worst year from the pandemic. So when you're looking at that, I mean, we feel good about the ambition there and our ability to be able to deliver on the margin improvement. We are obviously significantly accelerating the transformation and realization of the strategy with the acquisition of Stanley Security. There are 9 markets in Europe, where we are building a real position of strength either by combining Electronic Security, existing that we have or building, and that will definitely also help the overall case. So no concerns in terms of temporary -- I mean, I think, it's just a prudent thing to do that we now have significant integration and creation effort ahead of us in terms of really integrating Stanley over the next 3, 6, 12 months, but we will also have a significantly stronger offering to the clients and more future-proof position, which I think is important as well because technology is just becoming more and more important and even more so when you're looking at the challenges that we're seeing in the labor market, just finding people. So yes, I hope that answers your question. Thank you, Allen. So I mean to be specific on the extra sales, it's roughly 3% less as the share of sales this year compared to last year. So a significant reduction. And that is most pronounced in North America in the second quarter because there we were also running with significantly higher COVID-related extra sales in Q2 last year. And that is -- I mean that business is no longer there. So I think that -- and to your second question, related to the extra sales, we are now at levels that are more kind of normal levels. Some quarters, it's going to be a little bit higher than where we are right now. If we're looking -- if the past is a good guidance related to the future. And we're also starting to see that, that more and more events are starting to come back, but it's also been a little bit tentative. If you're looking at the things that we are doing, AGMs, for example, we might be doing quite a lot of when it's AGM season, sports events, other industry type of events across different verticals, et cetera. And those, as you know, in some areas, they've kind of started to resume normal activity in some areas not. And those are obviously activities that we will typically also benefit our extra sales and even if on a temporary basis. But that's also the whole definition of the extra sales of the temp business, as we call it. So I hope that gives the flavor. But on a year-on-year basis, around 3% less as a percentage of sales compared to last year's same period. I can add on there, related to the extra sales. I mean, in normal years, we normally are around 13% to 15% extra sales. And now, we are at 13%. So I would say we are sort of at the bottom of the normal range here as well -- as Magnus is saying here, there are AGMs and other type of temporary business that starts to increase going forward as well. So it might be that we have an opportunity here going forward to be a bit higher than we were in Q2. When it comes to then the organic sales growth overall, I mean looking at this, we would say, overall, around 4%, a bit less than that, we would estimate to be price increases and -- sorry, between 4% and 5%, I should say. We estimate to be around price increases and the remaining we see as volume here. And that is then derived from the aviation business recovery, the portfolio growth that we've seen in Europe and Iberia America, but also the strong Electronic Security and Solutions here as well. Thank you, Karl-Johan.

But you're right, we have these 2 components to handle as well in the second half year. So... At what point -- at what point in time are you referring to now? But I think exactly -- this will be, of course, one component of interest, and this is exactly something we will come back to here in August, but we will give you a full brief around that instead of commenting around that individually here now. Yes. Thank you. So on Ibero-America, it is true what you are reflecting on here. I mean, we are performing, I would say, driving improvements at a faster pace than what we would have anticipated. So that obviously then is yes. That's the simple reality. But we will also, when we are talking on the 24th, also provide new financial targets, I think it's prudent as well that we then come back and comment. And I promise to come back to that question in some more detail also in that update.\\r\\n And just on the second question, I mean the strategic logic is strong here. We feel very good, like I said, about the value creation case. We will provide a lot more detail on the 24th. But Andreas, maybe you have just one brief comment here before we continue. Yes. You have -- in the report here, you have an estimate related to the amortization of acquisition intangibles. And this is preliminary, of course. But the total amount allocated here is around USD 500 million, mainly then related to customer portfolio, which will be amortized over 15 years. So you will approximately have an amortization charge per year of USD 35 million, still being preliminary, but the information is there in Note 2 as well. I can also just come back to Sylvia here who had a question around the provision line in itself. And I think I gave the overall answer, and that still stands. But I just want to make it clear there that the bad debt provisions that we took in 2020 are not on the line provisions here. That is a reduction of account receivables. So there is no connection there. And then the movement on the provision line is related to a reduction in our pension liabilities, given the increased interest rate environment here as well. And that is something that goes through equity and not the income statement, to be clear there as well. Good. So unless there are any further questions, thank you, everyone, for your engagement. And as we said before, we're looking forward to seeing you for the event on the 24th of August. And in the meantime, everyone in the Northern Hemisphere, wishing then good continued hopefully summer time. Thank you.\",\n",

       " 'presentation': \"\\r\\nOperator   [1]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n (technical difficulty)\\r\\n [12] months ended 26th of March 2022. Thank you for joining us today, whether in the with us or via the webcast.\\r\\n The results were announced this morning eventually and are available on our website, www.delarue.com.\\r\\n I'm Louise Rich, Head of Investor Relations. And our CEO, Clive Vacher; and our CFO, Rob Harding, will present on the results for the year to you shortly. (Operator Instructions)\\r\\n Importantly, before we start, I'd like to draw your attention to the forward-looking statements within the results announcement and on Slide 2 of the presentation.\\r\\n And now I'd like to pass over to Clive.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [2]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone. And may I say it's good to see so many of you here in person after so long. Welcome to De La Rue's full year results for the 2021/'22 financial year. I am Clive Vacher, CEO.\\r\\n Before I start, I wanted to let you know that I feel a little hoarse this morning, but please rest assured, I have taken and tested negative for COVID-19 3x in the last 4 days, including this morning. So please just bear with me if I need to take a water break.\\r\\n I would like to give an overview of our operational performance for the year, and then I'll hand over to Rob Harding, our CFO, to give you more detail on the financial performance.\\r\\n Our group adjusted operating profit for the year was GBP 36.4 million, consistent with our reduced guidance in January. Activity in our legacy Identity Solutions business dropped to a negligible level this year. Stripping out its impact, our ongoing Currency and Authentication divisions have demonstrated strong performance with adjusted operating profit for Currency and Authentication, up 30.2% to GBP 35.8 million. Two years ago, these divisions combined generated just GDP 1.4 million on the same basis.\\r\\n We are seeing the benefits of the implementation of the Turnaround Plan flowing through. Authentication revenues rose 16.4% to GBP 90.3 million, giving an adjusted operating profit of GBP 16.3 million, a 44.2% increase on last year. Adjusted operating profitability in the Currency division increased by 20.4% to GBP 19.5 million on slightly lower revenue of GDP 280.9 million.\\r\\n Production of polymer substrate was up 40% with strong customer conversions from paper to polymer, and the full impact of the GBP 36 million cost reduction plan was seen as expected. The overall improvement in operating performance flowed through to cash flow, with an operating cash flow moving to an inflow of GBP 18.3 million compared with an operating cash outflow of GDP 5.6 million in the previous financial year.\\r\\n Net debt of GBP 71.4 million was slightly lower than expected and well within our covenant requirements and market expectations. Rob will go into more detail about the cash movements over the year.\\r\\n We continue to address legacy issues this year, securing an agreement with the trustee of the De La Rue pension scheme to bring forward the actuarial valuation of the scheme to April 2021. This led the scheme actuary to confirm that the remaining deficit can be funded through contributions remaining flat at GBP 15 million per year until March 2029, GBP 9.5 million per year less than the previous deficit reduction plan. This is a very substantial development as the new schedule of contributions will save De La Rue a total of GBP 57 million in cash outflows between financial year '23 to '24 and financial year '28 to '29, while enhancing the protections for the company's current and deferred pensioners.\\r\\n The profits for the year as a whole were, however, more modest than we had hoped at the start of the year. Both divisions were impacted in the second half by cost and supply headwinds, together with significant COVID-19-related absenteeism in our European factories due to the Omicron variant. Additionally, there were some revenue delays in both divisions.\\r\\n As COVID recedes, we are seeing some normalization of banknote print demand from the high levels seen in the early stages of the pandemic. In addition, as we move into financial year '23, like nearly every other business, De La Rue faces increasing challenges, especially due to world events.\\r\\n Turning now to the outlook for the current financial year. As we set out in our announcement this morning, we feel it prudent to revise our expectations for adjusted operating profit for this financial year coming. We now expect the outturn for the group adjusted operating profit this year to be broadly flat when compared to last year.\\r\\n We also expect the phasing of profits to return to historic patterns and be roughly 1/3 in the first half and 2/3 in the second half. Significant opportunities remain that provide upside potential to this outlook. However, these are generally balanced by further downside risks stemming from the possibility of further deterioration of the external economic environment.\\r\\n Since January, the global economic and geopolitical environment has deteriorated substantially, and it is this which has caused us to recalibrate our expectations for this year. Specifically, there are a net GBP 5 million of supply chain-related cost increases which the company is facing in this financial year. These fall into a number of areas, consistent with the current global economic picture.\\r\\n We have good contractual protection of our own energy demand through careful planning and decision-making, but we are seeing a number of our suppliers attempting to pass on their energy price raises to us. The rise in the oil price is particularly affecting inputs that are oil-derived, especially related to polymer and brand protection labels.\\r\\n Freight and logistics costs are similarly affected by the rise in the price of oil and lower global capacity due to the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China. The availability of semiconductors is slowly improving but remains somewhat uncertain. We are working hard to secure our requirements for the full financial year and continue to make progress.\\r\\n As a management team, we are currently focused on mitigating the cost rises. We will pass on some cost increases to customers. In Currency, these are somewhat limited due to the normalization of banknote demand post-COVID.\\r\\n In Authentication, the contracts are generally longer term and the price escalations within them somewhat more modest than what would be ideal in today's inflationary environment. That said, in both businesses, we are seeing opportunities for higher pricing in a number of new bids and have already secured some new work at higher prices.\\r\\n Finally, we are working further mitigations by continuing to strengthen our supply chain management. We are focusing on partially negotiating away some of the price increase demands as well as implementing more strategic measures such as dual sourcing, buying commodities forward and seeking further contractual protections from suppliers.\\r\\n We continue to monitor the various impacts of COVID-19. And positively, these are generally getting less severe over time in most territories. We only expect COVID to have a limited impact going forward, but we do continue to monitor the situation carefully.\\r\\n Overall, the actions we have taken over the last 2 years have created a resilient business with strong foundations and the potential for substantial future cash generation. As evidence for this, I would like to summarize the journey we are on, including what we have already achieved, what is ongoing and what we have yet to solve. All of these actions will form the backbone of our journey towards consistent free cash flow generation.\\r\\n Over the last 2 years, we have tackled a number of legacy issues to put the business on a more stable basis, including selling the Identity Solutions business; restructuring the 2 divisions; and taking out GBP 36 million of costs, cutting the number of banknote print sites and closing the Overton R&amp;D Center.\\r\\n We have extended our contracts with both the Bank of England and Microsoft. More recently, we have reduced future cash outflows to fund the pension deficit, established a new industry-leading ESG strategy and attained ISO 37001 Certification to provide an additional bolster to our anti-bribery and corruption policies.\\r\\n We continue to progress and mature substantial investment in transformation programs such as the doubling in size of our Malta facility, the doubling of our polymer production capacity and building further flexibility into our operations across De La Rue's manufacturing footprint.\\r\\n Our Currency R&amp;D strategy is market-orientated and focused on step changes in feature technology, as evidenced by our recent release to the market of a number of innovations that support our aim to convert the world to polymer.\\r\\n In Authentication, we are progressing well with implementing new contracted GRS schemes, with revenue on these new programs starting in the first half of this financial year. We remain strongly focused on the substantial GRS expansion opportunities and on developing the next generation of industry-leading and differentiated track-and-trace software.\\r\\n Central Bank digital currencies remain an area of interest to us, and we continue to watch developments and formulate our strategic thinking. As mentioned earlier, although we've made considerable progress in driving cost out of our business, we have had to go further and deeper in response to external headwinds.\\r\\n De La Rue is undergoing significant cultural transformation as well. We are more focused, leaner, more open and more aligned than before, with the business moving forward together in an exciting way.\\r\\n Finally, there are other issues that remain outstanding. The current leadership team inherited a number of long-term supplier contracts that we are still living with and which are causing some erosion of margins, especially in Currency. We continue to have the Venezuela receivable outstanding, and our IT systems do require improvement, and we will address this group-wide at the right time. And we never forget that once the business is generating sufficient cash, our priority must be to reinstate dividends to shareholders.\\r\\n Turning now to the markets in which we operate and to remind you of the underlying strength of our core markets. Despite the rise of electronic payments, the worldwide demand for physical cash remains resilient and strong. Data supplied by central banks to the IMF shows significant rises of cash in circulation over the past 12 years. This is the case in the G20 countries and is even more marked in developing countries, which are De La Rue's strongholds.\\r\\n The worldwide pattern is that demand for cash continues to grow at small single-digit percentages each year. Cash demand is fueled by substantial global population growth; inflation; the fact that cash is a symbol of national identity; its need to be replaced in reasonably short cycles; and importantly, by its function as a store of wealth. Current dynamics are that demand for cash is normalizing following the COVID-19 spike in demand, but it is not declining. Current international inflationary pressures may increase demand. These factors, as well as our enviable position in polymer, mean that we feel good about the currency market in the years to come.\\r\\n Expanding on that last point, we are 1 of only 2 providers globally of polymer substrate for banknotes. The business case for polymer is clear. Polymer notes are cleaner, longer lasting and easier to recycle than their paper counterparts. They are also more secure, and with our increasing suite of security features, becoming even more so.\\r\\n The market of polymer is growing and gaining momentum, with an estimated GDP 2 billion additional notes annually on polymer now compared to 2019. Substantial volume banknote-issuing countries are converting, some with full families and some have started with single denominations and are expanding to others.\\r\\n At the same time, De La Rue's market share measured in volume has increased from approximately 25% in 2019 to 33% today, and we aim to capture up to 50% of the market in the next 2 to 3 years. We already have more customers and denominations than the competitor. And even in 12 to 18 months' time, only just over 5% of the world's bank notes by volume will be on polymer, so the opportunities are substantial.\\r\\n We, therefore, made exactly the right decision to invest in more than doubling our polymer manufacturing capacity at the time we did. The new polymer line is now operational and has started to run customer product. In the last financial year, we produced 40% more polymer substrate than we did the year before, and we expect further growth in volumes this year.\\r\\n Turning now to the Authentication market. The World Economic Forum estimates that illicit trade is a $2.2 trillion drain each year on the global economy. Our brand business provides a range of solutions using physical and digital elements to combat the trade in counterfeit goods. We have been a supplier of antipiracy solutions to Microsoft for over 23 years and have recently seen strong sales in other sectors as well.\\r\\n It is said that $40 billion is lost each year through the illicit tobacco trade, and the World Health Organization's FCTC protocol is driving adoption of tax stamp schemes to push out dangerous boot-led tobacco products from the market. Countries, therefore, have a double incentive to implement a delivery tax stamp solution, compliance with the FCTC protocol and an increased tax revenue stream. De La Rue has been successful as a supplier of choice in a range of countries, with all 5 of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries that have implemented the tobacco tax treaty choosing De La Rue.\\r\\n As you can see from this slide, 65 countries have now signed up to the FCTC illicit trade protocol, an increase of 6 countries since 2020. And of these, 31 countries have yet to implement a scheme. While, due to COVID, countries have not contracted or implemented these schemes in the time frames originally anticipated, there is a large pipeline of opportunities. And we are now seeing some good movements, both in terms of implementation and in terms of interest in new schemes.\\r\\n Further opportunity comes in the expansion of existing tax stamp schemes. A country may, for example, expand a tobacco scheme to incorporate drinks at a later date. Overall, therefore, we remain positive about the potential of authentication markets in which we operate.\\r\\n Looking now at our divisional performance in more detail. In Authentication, as I outlined earlier, we have seen strong growth across the business. In GRS, we received 5 new contracts for the supply of tax stamps and solutions. These are typically 5-year contracts for the sole supply of a solution to track, trace and collect revenue on goods such as tobacco or drinks in a particular territory. Implementation of these countries -- excuse me, implementation of these contracts, which often require the passing of primary legislation in territory, were delayed somewhat by COVID-19 restrictions, but we have seen positive movement in this regard in recent months.\\r\\n In addition, contracts won in previous years produced strong revenue, with a full year of revenue seen from the Ghana Revenue Authority and the HMRC Tobacco track and trace system.\\r\\n Brand protection also had a year of positive growth. We saw strong revenue from the information technology sector, having announced that we had renewed our contract with Microsoft to protect their products for another 5 years. In addition, sales of Authentication solutions to the pharmaceutical industry and to the vaping sector were strong.\\r\\n In September 2021, we announced a substantial expansion of our manufacturing capability at our Malta site due for completion in 2024. This will more than double our capacity for the manufacturing of Authentication labels to address this growing demand.\\r\\n Lastly, we began to supply ID pages for the new Australian passport towards the year-end. This is another ongoing contract with a full-year's demand in financial year '23.\\r\\n In Currency, we saw a continuation of customers switching to polymer. This trend included the completion of the 4 series of the Bank of England notes with the release of the new GBP 50 note; a new series of 6 polymer banknotes for Jamaica; a BHT 20 note issued by the Bank of Thailand; and the new GBP 100 note issued by the Bank of Scotland, who became one of the early adopters of De La Rue's new holographic foil-striked security feature.\\r\\n In addition, and most recently, in February 2022, we launched Safeguard ASSURE, an embedded covert security feature for polymer, which can be detected by central banks even if no other aspect of the banknote is remaining. The launch of ASSURE makes Safeguard the most complete banknote substrate available.\\r\\n In addition to the continuing trend of paper-to-polymer conversion, we continue to drive rationalization and flexibility across our banknote printing portfolio. We have reallocated a number of key assets from our Gateshead facility to other sites and have agreed a paper use agreement with the Bank of England for the use of their equipment for export work from our Debden facility.\\r\\n And to round up, Identity Solutions revenue has, as expected, dropped substantially this year. And going forward, it will deliver limited revenue and profitability.\\r\\n Before I hand over to Rob, I'd like to take a moment to update you on our efforts in respect of responsible business. As our purpose is to secure trust between people, business and governments and given the nature of our business, responsible business or ESG touches every area of what we do. We are committed to leading our industry on environmental sustainability, including submitting targets to the science-based targets initiative to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, consistent with keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees. We have committed also to being carbon neutral in our own operations by 2030.\\r\\n Undertaking business responsibly is, however, broader than just looking after the environment. At De La Rue, we promote an inclusive culture that values diversity and where health, safety and well-being is a top priority. The overwhelmingly positive responses that we had to our most recent employee survey are testaments to our efforts in this area. We have a strong result to protect human rights in our own business and in our wider supply chain.\\r\\n In addition, we have a strong governance system, which helps us deliver on our responsibilities. The Code of Business Principles, which all employees must adhere to, sets out the core principles of how we behave and work. This, along with much more information on the way in which we are to undertake business responsibly, is available on our recently expanded website.\\r\\n Looking briefly at some of our recent achievements in sustainability, we now power our U.K. sites exclusively from renewable sources. We met our KPI last year of increasing manufacturing efficiency by reducing our energy use per ton of good output by 7.5%.\\r\\n We recycle all of our U.K. polymer waste, and our use of water is down substantially over the last 4 years. For these efforts, we have been rewarded for the second year in a row by being named in the top quartile of Europe's Climate Leaders in the Financial Times, the sister survey for the second year running. This year, we were ranked 41 out of 400 companies across Europe.\\r\\n And now I will pass over to Rob to cover more details on our financials.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Rob Harding,  De La Rue plc - CFO &amp; Executive Director   [3]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Clive, and good morning, everyone. Firstly, I'd like to take you through the key highlights from our income statement.\\r\\n At the top of this page, you can see adjusted revenues for the full year came in at GBP 375.1 million, and that's down 3.3% on last year's revenues of GBP 388.1 million. The key driver of this fall is the cessation of revenues from our ID business, but I'll cover this shortly on the next slide.\\r\\n These lower revenues passed through to lower year-on-year gross profits, with GBP 97.6 million for this year versus GDP 107.8 million gross profits for last year. And similar to revenue, the ID business is a key driver of this drop, with essentially no profits coming from ID versus the GBP 12.6 million gross profits that we had for FY '21.\\r\\n If we exclude ID, gross profits for the rest of the group have increased year-on-year, with Authentication's gross profits increasing 15.4% to GBP 34.5 million, and that's more than offsetting a 3.2% reduction in Currency to GBP 63.2 million.\\r\\n Next, on this slide, you can see adjusted operating profits of GBP 36.4 million. And this is driven by year-on-year operating profit growth across both Currency and Authentication, with Currency's profits up 20.4% to GBP 19.5 million from GBP 16.2 million in the prior year, and that's despite the fall in its gross profits.\\r\\n Authentication's profits are up 44.2% to GBP 16.3 million from GBP 11.3 million in the prior year. So from a group perspective, it's the ID profits in the prior year that's driving that overall year-on-year fall from GBP 38.1 million to GBP 36.4 million.\\r\\n Adjusted operating margins are broadly flat year-on-year at 9.7%, which is obviously a positive for outcome for the business given the environment that we've been operating in. IFRS operating profits of GBP 29.7 million have more than doubled versus the prior year, and this is driven by much lower exceptional items for FY '22 of GBP 5.7 million compared to that of the prior year where we had GBP 22.6 million. And this is filtering through an IFRS margin increase from 3.6% to 7.9% year-on-year.\\r\\n Finally, on this slide, we have the EPS metrics. And on an adjusted basis, prior to any exceptional items, this is down by 13p, but is up 186.5% on an IFRS basis after the impact of lower exceptional items charged during the current year.\\r\\n If we move to the next slide, this is really providing more details on adjusted revenue and gives you a visual for the 3.3% revenue decline year-on-year, from GBP 388.1 million revenue for '21 on the left-hand side to the FY '22 revenue of GDP 375.1 million.\\r\\n To the right of this chart, you can see this is impact of the cessation of ID revenues of GBP 19.8 million, with this business providing minimal revenue for this year following its disposal back in Q4 of 2019. Adjusting for this, our continuing businesses experienced year-on-year revenue growth of GBP 6.8 million, with GDP 12.7 million of revenue growth for Authentication, part dampened by GBP 5.9 million decline in Currency.\\r\\n If we move on to the next slide, we can see a visual for adjusted operating profits, again, showing the key movements between last year's profit of GBP 38.1 million on the left of this chart to the GBP 36.4 million.\\r\\n Again, like revenue, we see, again, the impact of the ID disposal, the GBP 10 million to the right of this slide. But you can see from the yellow-shaded box that we've had strong underlying growth across our 2 divisions, with Currency up GBP 3.3 million or 20-odd percent to GBP 19.5 million adjusted profits. And Authentication, up GBP 5 million or 44.2% to GBP 16.3 million.\\r\\n If I move on to cash flow. On this slide, we show the various cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities and how this has influenced the overall cash flow for the year.\\r\\n If I start to the left-hand side of this chart, you can see the GBP 16.5 million of inflows from operating activities off the back of our GBP 36.4 million of adjusted operating profits. The key outflows that you can see in respect of this left-hand side are our own working capital and pensions.\\r\\n On working capital, there's been a GBP 17.2 million outflow, and the main driver of this is really in our Currency division, where we've seen a year-on-year reduction to our advanced payments of GBP 23.8 million, with GBP 14.3 million of advanced payments at the end of '22 versus GBP 38.1 million of advanced payments in the prior year. We've had approximately GBP 20 million of advanced payments coming through just after the year-end. So really, the vast majority of this delta is timing related.\\r\\n On Pensions, there's been the GBP 16.4 million outflow that you can see on this chart. And that's the GBP 15 million payable under the recovery plan and the schedule of contributions we have there plus administration costs.\\r\\n You can then see there's some smaller operating flows on this page, GDP 3.7 million of provision releases, things like warranty provisions; GBP 2.5 million of cash exceptionals, again, notably lower than last year; GBP 1.8 million of tax. Plus a GDP 4.1 million adjustment for noncash items, which covers things like share-based payments charges.\\r\\n In the middle of this chart, you can see the GBP 7.7 million inflows from financing activities, which, most notably includes a GBP 17 million drawdown on our facility over the year. And this has been offset with outflows of GBP 2.2 million of lease liability payments, GDP 6.2 million of interest, plus a noncontrolling interest dividends of GBP 0.9 million.\\r\\n Lastly, to the right of this chart, you can see the GBP 25.8 million outflow from investing activities, and that's really essentially driven by that CapEx outflow to support the ongoing delivery of our Turnaround and CapEx spend. So overall, the results -- this results in a GBP 1.6 million outflow that you can see to the right-hand side of this slide, which obviously includes that GBP 17 million drawdown of our facility.\\r\\n If I can now move on to my last slide and cover off net debt and pensions before passing back to Clive. As Clive's highlighted, we landed net debt at GBP 71.4 million at year-end compared to the prior year net debt of GBP 52.3 million. And this year-end position is very much consistent with the message we've given previously, with net debt growing as we continue to spend the CapEx that supports our turnaround delivery.\\r\\n The top of this slide shows our overall facility position, the GBP 275 million facility, and that's got another 18 months on it before it matures at the end of -- the beginning of December 2023. We maintained significant headroom on our 2 covenants with a net interest covenant at a ratio of 7.3x, and that's versus the covenant level of 2.8. And the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1.46x, and that's versus a covenant level of 3.\\r\\n At the bottom of the slide, you've got pensions and the valuation of the group's U.K.-defined benefit pension scheme on an accounting basis at the year-end is a surplus of GBP 31.6 million, and that's versus a deficit of GBP 18.5 million in the prior year. These movements from surface to deficits are really driven by changes to the discount rate applied at each year-end.\\r\\n As Clive also noted, we managed to update our schedule of contributions in our recovery plan payments to the pension scheme, and we've now agreed to keep this at GBP 15 million, and it was due to increase from GBP 15 million to GBP 24.5 million from April '23 onwards for the next 6 years. And that change is essentially avoiding an outflow of cash of GBP 57 million over the next 6 years or from the 6 years beginning April 2023. So that's a significant improvement to our future cash flows.\\r\\n Additional contributions are only payable to the scheme in extreme circumstances, and our next triennial valuation is set for April 2024.\\r\\n If I can now pass back to Clive to cover off our summary and outlook.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [4]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you, Rob.\\r\\n So in summary, we have delivered strong operating profit growth in our ongoing divisions in the financial year 2021, '22, along with a substantially improved positive operating cash flow. We are making significant progress in our transformation program, but the deteriorating economic and geopolitical situation is providing an unpredictable series of headwinds on the business. For this reason, we now expect adjusted operating profit for the current financial year will be broadly flat on that achievement last year.\\r\\n Despite the unprecedented macro environment, we continue to make progress with addressing legacy issues and streamlining operations. Further opportunities remain here that could provide additional upside in due course. The markets in which the company operates remains strong and continue to grow. We've made considerable progress in the turnaround of the business since we first set out our plans just over 2 years ago. We have created an ongoing business that is producing meaningful profits and an improving trend in operating cash flow.\\r\\n This year, we will progress towards completion of the investment projects outlined in the turnaround plan, after which, we should see a normalization of capital spend. With the pension schedule of contributions significantly improved and our continued consistent strategy execution over the coming year, our objective remains to generate cash flows capable of supporting sustainable dividends to shareholders, especially once the external cost environment stabilizes and we have continued our progress in solving the outstanding legacy issues in the business.\\r\\n So we'll now move on to Q&amp;A. And I understand we're going to ask for questions in the room first and then address questions from those who are listening remotely.\\r\\n\",\n",
       " 'qa': \"\\r\\n James Beard,  Numis Securities Limited, Research Division - Analyst   [1]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n James Beard at Numis. A couple of questions, all right. Firstly, on Sri Lanka, obviously, pretty tumultuous situation in that country right now. How does that potentially impact production from your facility, and indeed, supply of raw materials and distribution from that facility? And what sort of -- have you factored that into your sort of expectations for FY '23?\\r\\n And then second question, just on -- I guess, sort of relatively general question on GRS authentication. Of your GRS authentication customers, who are tobacco customers, what proportion of those have also subsequently signed up for other products, alcohol or soft drinks, as an example?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [2]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. Thanks, James. So Sri Lanka, we're obviously monitoring the situation very carefully there because of our substantial operations. We have only so far experienced about a 36-hour shutdown of the factory when the demonstrations were at their peak. We have continued production now. It is open. It is running as normal. We have all of the supply that we need. We have diesel generator backups for the power supply outages, and we are able to be prioritized in the supply of diesel. And we are continuing to work with the bus companies to make sure they have enough diesel to get our employees into work.\\r\\n So at the moment, the situation is that it's going to have limited impact, which is reason why I haven't highlighted it in my talk today. But obviously, we will watch the situation very carefully going forward. The good situation -- the good thing about our position in Sri Lanka is that we get all sorts of support from the government as a priority business in relation to curfew passes and other diesel availability and other key inputs to our process. So at the moment, we are not factoring in any substantial reduction in either output or performance from our Sri Lanka facility.\\r\\n In relation to the GRS customers, this is a sort of gradual process. So it's probably not easy for us to just say what percentage, but I would say that a good substantial number of the contracts that we sign up either have a sequence of tax stamp implementation, starting with one and then the other, upfront or that when governments see the improvement in the fight against illicit trade and the improvement in tax revenues, they often come back for more. So I think over the next few years, we will see many countries on multiple schemes.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Unidentified Analyst,    [3]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n [Marcus Gilbert], [WebQuery] Capital. You talked about a post-COVID normalization of banknote demand. Could you help us understand what you mean by normalization?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [4]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. So during the COVID pandemic, and it may seem completely counterintuitive because it does to me in a way until you get into the detail of it, there was a very significant spike in demand for cash. And that was -- there was more dollars, more euros and more sterling issued during the time as well. So this isn't just a developing nation phenomenon. But it's a pattern that we see regularly when there are global economic crises or global shocks to the system that there is a run to cash.\\r\\n So what we're now seeing, as we're getting past that, we're seeing that countries have stocked up and that the demand is relaxing. But I think it's very important to say the demand is relaxing and going back to a more normal steady state than it is we see a trend towards reduction.\\r\\n So what that really means for us is that we are just a little bit less comfortable in time frames of orders coming in. But when we look at the overall outlook for banknote demand in this year and next year, it's actually very strong, and the margins are looking very strong also. So we feel very comfortable about the situation. It's just banknotes are cyclical anyway. And at the moment, there's just this post-COVID sort of relaxation of demand.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Unidentified Analyst,    [5]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n And just if I can ask a little bit of a generalist question as a bit of a beginning on De La Rue. But can you just remind us if you give the statistics of your banknote sales per client country, and just understand going forward, 5 or 10 years, presumably there will be a decline in demand from developed countries and continued population rise in emerging economies, which might lead to sales of lower-end banknotes with lower margins. Can you help me understand the trend there?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [6]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. So try and just give you a picture of how we see the currency market developing. So first of all, we have to remember, if you look at the latest Bank of England study, they are saying that actually only 24% of the banknotes issued are transacted. So the vast majority of them are -- of hard currencies are stored well. But if we look at the overall trend, you've got the -- obviously, the factor that reduces demand, which is the transactional side, which is going to increasingly digitize, but then you have all these other factors that ensure that the demand remains very resilient.\\r\\n And I've gone through some of them today, population growth, symbols of national identity, changes in presidents or whatever will change banknotes, and they're very important functions as a store of wealth. And obviously, inflationary pressures have quite an impact on the demand.\\r\\n What we also need to factor in, and this is why I am very comfortable with our position in the market, is that this -- with this trend of paper to polymer, we believe, and we have signed up to the thinking that, that trend is going to increase, and indeed, is going to accelerate. And we have seen that acceleration happen over the last couple of years.\\r\\n So even if total demand does decline and we see no sign of that yet, we still feel we're in an absolutely wonderful position to be able to capitalize on that growing trend of polymer banknotes, because 95% of the world's volume still has yet to convert.\\r\\n So when all that -- when I put all that together, our view of currency over the next decade, let's say, is it's a wonderful place to be, and we have probably the best position of any company in it.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Unidentified Analyst,    [7]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n So can you help us -- remind us what proportion of sales in developed economies are and -- to understand the switch to polymer in an emerging economy where the population is growing, increases the price per banknote by roughly how much?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [8]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. So there's just so many different variables in this, so it's very difficult to just give you a real sort of percentage of something like that. But I mean, I think we have gone off the initial mandate that if you look at the Bank of England's reports, you will see that they -- the initial purchase price is generally something like 70% higher for polymer banknotes, but they last 3 to 5x longer. So the business case is very, very clear.\\r\\n And in terms of, if we're talking about the strongholds of us, which is in the developing world, we're seeing as strong a conversion to polymer in the developing world as we are in the established countries. And in fact, if we look at where our competitor was strong, our competitor is strong in polymer because they got in earlier. They were the first to market. And so they got all of the traditional countries exclusively to start with. We have now broken that exclusivity in those countries. But generally, our focus is on the new emerging conversions over to polymer. So...\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Rob Harding,  De La Rue plc - CFO &amp; Executive Director   [9]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. If I give a kind of view in terms of numbers here. I mean, if you're looking at the overall group revenues of GDP 375 million, you're probably looking at about GDP 200 million for Middle East/Africa, another kind of GDP 45 million for Asia. So approaching GDP 250 million of the GDP 375 million is coming from those regions versus U.K. and the rest of Europe. You're talking about right about GBP 100 million or so there. So that gives you kind of the emphasis in terms of the merits of kind of where we're doing business globally.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thomas Andrew Rands,  Investec Bank plc, Research Division - Industrials Research Analyst   [10]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thomas Rands from Investec. Just to follow on from that polymer question and with one eye on the kind of increasing capitalized development costs and the cash flow, can you just talk us through how your security features portfolio and the R&amp;D that you have been spending and plan to spend on that is helping you convert those -- or help convert those customers to polymer? Obviously, the eye on polymer being generally more secure kind of product, and what customers are asking of you from those security features?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [11]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thanks, Tom. So the security features arena on polymer is really important to our future strategy. So if we look at the paper market, paper security -- the paper security features, so threads and foils and inks and things that make a banknote more secure, that market is very saturated. It's -- there's lots of competition in pretty much every type of feature and very, very difficult to increase market share. And overall, that market is pretty stagnant at the moment.\\r\\n When we look at polymer, there's lots of other dynamics going on. So number one is that there are very few competitors in security features. So for each security feature, you're sometimes up against one other company. But generally, it's an uncrowded market.\\r\\n And then secondly, exactly as you highlighted, Tom, the introduction of more and more security features actually supports the case for conversion to polymer because, a, polymer is more secure anyway because it has features naturally like windows and things. But adding more and more security features just adds to that argument.\\r\\n So our security features strategy is game-changing new features released at speed over the next 2 years, including some really game-changing ones that's nothing like it in the market, and they are coming out. Putting features in the actual note itself, instead of just applied and thereby strengthening the conversion to polymer and also incremental revenue margin on top of normal banknote printing and normal substrate provision.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Paul Sharma,  De La Rue plc - Head of IR   [12]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Okay. Thank you. We've got no more questions for the room. So we're going to move to questions from the webcast.\\r\\n First question is from Mike Allen from Zeus Capital. Could you provide us with some more color on easing of semiconductor situation, please? What industries you are facing the most competition from?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [13]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. So as many of you know, one of the challenges we had in the first quarter of -- sorry, the fourth quarter of last financial year, first quarter of this calendar year was that we were let down in terms of semiconductor supply at fairly short notice. The situation has improved substantially, and we are running with all our requirements as it stands today. So our line is running at full whack.\\r\\n And as we go forward, I think fair to say that we probably have something like 3/4 of our requirements for the full financial year secure. And because we are very proactive, we've already ordered and had confirmation of our demands for next financial year. So the risk remains, how do we plug that additional 25%, and we're working that very, very hard. And secondly, can we make sure that we hold the suppliers to actually delivering to those promises?\\r\\n And I think generally, whereas over the last 6 to 9 months, we were competing in a very sparse availability market against industries such as the auto industry, I think now the semiconductor suppliers are able to satisfy both. So while we're not there yet for all of the requirements this year, I think we've got a pretty good shot at it.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Paul Sharma,  De La Rue plc - Head of IR   [14]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you. Next question is from Susie Harris from BDM. With polymer banknotes lasting longer in circulation, how do you anticipate this will impact the longer-term currency projections?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [15]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n So this is a question that we feel quite a bit. And I would be extraordinarily worried about it if we didn't have our position in polymer that we do. And if I didn't see that the trend was accelerating towards conversion. So the logic is, of course, as more and more countries convert to polymer, they will refresh their banknotes less frequently.\\r\\n However, the key to our strategy for the next, at least a decade, probably longer, is that our focus is on the first conversions of each country. So there's 95% by volume of the market and 88% of the market by denomination that we have to go after. So because we are 1 of 2 polymer substrate providers, we will not, in our view, be impacted too badly by the fact that these notes last longer because there will be this wave of demand for many years to come in the conversion arena.\\r\\n Now when I sit and I think about or what's it like in 15 years' time where you've got total digitization everywhere and everyone's on polymer, then it may well be different. But I think for the next 5 to 10 years, and I look at it as the next decade, I think we're extremely well positioned.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Paul Sharma,  De La Rue plc - Head of IR   [16]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Next question is from Bobby, who's a private investor. When do most of the legacy supplier contracts come up for renewal? The ones that are creating financial headwinds and were mentioned as an outstanding item for the company to address.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [17]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n So most of the sort of smaller ones are probably within the next couple of years will expire. Or if they don't expire, then our major financial obligations are released as it were. Obviously, the contract that we get asked about a lot is our paper supply contract form portals, and that runs to 2028.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Paul Sharma,  De La Rue plc - Head of IR   [18]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n (Operator Instructions) Next question is from Susie Harris from BDM. What level of opportunity exists in your business transformation project? Can you quantify this?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [19]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Sorry, can you just repeat that?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Paul Sharma,  De La Rue plc - Head of IR   [20]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n What level of opportunity exists in your business transformation project? Are you able to quantify this?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [21]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Yes. So if we look at -- so the business transformation in terms of the operational footprint of our company is that we are generally reducing the number of print sites, concentrating operations in fewer sites, which has significantly less cost. We've already quantified that there's GBP 36 million of cost out that's happening through our transformation activities, and that's already secured. We've now got additional several million, I would say, single-digit million of additional opportunities this year and further opportunities thereafter in terms of further transformation.\\r\\n So the other angle on it is that if we look at the currency business, in particular, which is the vast majority of our physical operations, you will see that we're running around the 6% to 7% operating profit at the moment.\\r\\n When you look at the legacy contracts, and if we can sort those out, and the additional efficiencies that we are driving through the transformation program, then I would like to think that we can get Currency up to double-digit operating margin, so in support of, obviously, in terms of looking at high teens at the moment and heading northwards. So there's plenty of opportunity out there for further transformation.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Paul Sharma,  De La Rue plc - Head of IR   [22]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n That's great. Thank you for that, Clive.\\r\\n Next question is from Mark Deakes from Delaroux. With the increase in consumer e-commerce, is online brand protection an area that De La Rue should consider moving into?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [23]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Online brand protection is one area we have taken a look at. The view that we currently take in that market is that it's incredibly fragmented and rather challenging to automate. There's a lot of manual effort to fight online counterfeiting at the moment. And the contract size is generally much smaller than what we're used to as a De La Rue company.\\r\\n So whereas on the surface of it, online brand monitoring is -- seems quite an exciting area, and I have no doubt it's growing, I'm not sure that it fits exactly into our portfolio. I'm thinking strategically, we might try other things first.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Paul Sharma,  De La Rue plc - Head of IR   [24]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you. And our final question, which is a follow-up question from Bobby, who's a private investor. Is the company reassessing the chances of recovery on the Venezuela receivable that was previously fully provided against?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [25]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n So the Venezuela receivable remains a receivable. And it's important once again to understand that it's not the Central Bank of Venezuela that is not prepared to pay that receivable. It's the fact that the sanctions on the country mean that no bank will transact that money. So we have no plans in anything that we are planning for at the moment as to when that may come in. But we remain positive that at some point, when the regime may change or when sanctions are lifted for any other reason on Venezuela, that we will ultimately get paid. But it is so uncertain as to when that we don't factor it into any of our forward planning.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Paul Sharma,  De La Rue plc - Head of IR   [26]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Thank you. No further questions from the webcast. Now I'd like to pass it back. We've got a further question from the room, so we'll move to the room.\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Unidentified Analyst,    [27]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Just another 2 questions, if I may. You talked about passing on some of the price -- the cost increases that you're suffering from at the moment. Can you explain why it's only some and you can't pass on all the cost increases?\\r\\n And a second question on the outlook you gave for paper banknotes, which is stagnant or decline, and sharp growth in polymer, which is going to be fantastic for you, can you just help us understand who are the producers of paper banknotes? Who are the producers of the polymer banknotes? And what are the barriers to entry, which are going to mean that the paper producers will not move into your market?\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n Clive Graham Vacher,  De La Rue plc - CEO &amp; Executive Director   [28]\\r\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n All right, great. So let's deal with the first question. So the -- if we think about the Currency arena, one of the reasons why we can't just pass on cost increases to customers is that the overall demand, as I mentioned, is normalizing post-COVID. So whereas our European competitors were very busy printing the euro over the last couple of years, that demand has eased a bit.\\r\\n So of course, they are looking to fill their capacity elsewhere. So it just means that the market has become a little bit more competitive. So we are very, very good at finding the right price points, but it does mean that the prices are not increasing by the same percentage as the inputs at the current time.\\r\\n Now in other parts of the Currency business, so in the substrate and the features, there's probably more opportunity. But again, we're in competitive markets right across the board.\\r\\n To answer your second question on paper banknotes. So the market for banknotes in general is -- and you're asking who prints them. So most factories can move from paper to polymer banknote print very, very well with very little additional capital equipment. So -- and as it stands right now, somewhere between 85% and 90% of the world's banknotes are printed by state printworks themselves. And obviously, the majority of those are on paper.\\r\\n So in terms of the opportunity, the big opportunity for us is to provide substrate into state printworks into that 85% to 90%. Where we don't print, we just supply the substrate, that's the big growth area in polymer. Obviously, we will supply to our own factories, and we do supply to competitive factories as well in the commercial world. But that's where the main opportunity lies. And of course, we are 2 polymer providers in the world versus probably more than 20 paper mills in the world. So one of the interesting dynamics at the moment is what's happening in the paper market and the paper mill market in general.\\r\\n In terms of barriers to entry, it's -- on polymer, the barrier to entry is less actually the capital side. So unlike a paper mill, which is incredibly capital-intensive and requires a lot of upfront investment, the upfront investment for polymer -- I mean, we've gone public and said that our new polymer line cost us GBP 20 million, so not prohibitive. The barrier to entry comes in the actual technology in what we do to the base film to make it printable in terms of conductive and various properties of what we have to put into that polymer to make it printable downstream.\\r\\n And that is something that we have been working on now for 15 years, and we still haven't perfected, even though we have the very best polymer product out there and the most complete. So any new entrant would go through a similar journey. And I think that, that will be quite a challenge. But I'm also realistic in the fact that this is such an attractive market that it would not surprise me at some point that a third entrant came in.\\r\\n Okay. So thank you very much. And I think just to conclude very briefly. We've had a few bumps in the road, and we can really honestly point those bumps being as a result of the world environment that we're all struggling with. I am absolutely convinced that we're on the right path. I'm absolutely convinced that the Turnaround Plan and the transformation strategy that we are undertaking is the right way.\\r\\n And I think if I can get you to think of it as if most of the Currency investment that we outlined at the time of the equity raise is complete and paid for, and there's still some more authentication investment. But once we get to the back end over the next sort of year or so to the back end of that investment program, then we normalize back to normal capital spend levels, we've already sorted out our pension.\\r\\n So if you think about it roughly as GBP 15 million to the pension and GBP 15 million to normal capital expenditure levels, and then you look at us going further forward on our operating profit from where we are today and you look at the EBITDA that results out of that, and I do think it's very clear that we will be generating positive free cash flow within the not-too-distant future.\\r\\n Thanks very much for your time today.\\r\"}"
