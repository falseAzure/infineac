Overview
========

.. start overview_wo

InFineac is a Python package that extracts financial insights from earnings
calls using NLP. Earnings calls are a rich source of information for investors,
that are held quarterly by publicly traded companies. 
It heavily uses the spaCy_ and BERTopic_ libraries for the NLP tasks.

.. start install

Install
=======

First create a new conda environment with python 3.10 and activate it:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n infineac python=3.10
    conda activate infineac


Then install this repository as a package, the ``-e`` flag installs the package
in editable mode, so you can make changes to the code and they will be
reflected in the package.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .

All the requirements are specified in the ``projcet.toml`` file with the needed
versions.

.. end install


.. start quickstart

Quickstart
==========

The ``scripts`` folder contains the scripts to load the data and extract the
topics.

Load the data
-------------

The ``load_data.py`` script loads the data from the xml-files and saves it as a
(compressed) pickle.

.. code-block:: bash

    python scripts/load_save_data.py

-p, --path      Path to directory of earnings calls transcripts
-c, --compress      Whether to compress the pickle file


Create Corpus
-------------

The ``create_corpus.py`` script creates a corpus from the data by extracting
relevant passages from the earnings calls. The corpus is saved as a compressed pickle file.

.. code-block:: bash

    python scripts/create_corpus.py

-p, --path       Path to pickle/lz4 file containing the earnings calls transcripts
-y, --year       Year to filter events by - all events before this year will be removed
-k, --keywords       Keywords to filter events by - all events not containing these keywords will be removed
-s, --sections       Section/s to extract passages from
-w, --window         Context window size in sentences
-par, --paragraphs   Whether to include subsequent paragraphs
-j, --join           Whether to join adjacent sentences
-a, --answers        Whether to extract answers from the Q&A section if keywords are present in the preceding question.
-rk, --remove_keywords   Whether to remove keywords from the extracted passages
-rn, --remove_names      Whether to remove names from the extracted passages
-rs, --remove_strategies  Whether to remove stopwords from the extracted passages
-ra, --remove_additional_words    Whether to remove additional words from the extracted passages


Extract Topics
--------------

The ``extract_topics.py`` script extracts the topics from a corpus of earnings
calls and saves them as a csv-file.

.. code-block:: bash

    python scripts/extract_topics.py

-p PATH       Path to directory of earnings calls transcripts

Earnings Calls
==============

Earnings calls are conference calls conducted by publicly traded companies with
their shareholders, investors, analysts, and the general public to discuss
their financial performance for a specific period - typically held quarterly.
These calls usually take place shortly after the release of the company's
quarterly financial reports.

During an earnings call, key members of the company's leadership, such as the
CEO, CFO or other executives, provide insights and analysis about the company's
financial results, operations, strategies, and any other relevant developments.
They often cover topics like revenue, net income, expenses, margins and
forward-looking guidance and plans for the upcoming quarter or year.

The earnings call is a **key source of information** for investors, as it
provides insights into the company's financial performance and future
prospects.


Data
====

The data used in this project stems from transcript of earnings calls provided
by Refinitiv_ The data is not publicly available and has to be purchased from
`Refinitiv Events`_.


Structure
---------

The data is provided in .xml format, with each xml-file containing the
transcript of a single earnings call as well as some metadata, like the title,
city, company name and date of the call. The transcript itself is structured
into two three parts: 

* Participants (corporate and conference call participants)
* Presentation
* Q&A

Both the presentation and the Q&A session are structured into
sections, which are comprised of the speaker and the corresponding text. The
presentation is held by the corporate participants. In the Q&A session, the
corporate participants answer questions from the conference call participants.
An operator moderates the presentation as well as the Q&A session.
